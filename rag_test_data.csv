The provided product details and reviews are for the BoAt BassHeads100 Wired Headset, but the question about a reviewer's appreciation for specific features given a rating of 3 out of 5 and a 'Fair' summary actually matches the details of the realme Buds2 Wired Headset.

However, I can provide some general insights.

The customers in the reviews seemed to have issues with the products, such as one side of the earphone not working properly, connection issues, and charging issues. 

If a customer suspects that their product is not brand new, they may:

* Check the packaging for any signs of tampering or opening
* Inspect the product for any physical damage or wear
* Verify the product's warranty and serial number
* Check the product's performance and test it thoroughly

However, in the provided reviews, there is no specific mention of the customers taking these steps. The issues mentioned in the reviews seem to have arisen after using the products for some time.
