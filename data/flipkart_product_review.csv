B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Great tool for busy mom,"First time Apple Watch user and I am very happy with the purchase. As a mom of toddler, this is very helpful tool so that I get notification while my phone is inside stroller or diaper bag and chasing my child in the park. I also love the GPS and emergency notification that I can share with my family. I have started to work out little more and care for health as it encourage to stand up, track movement etc which is very helpful. I’m impressed with the battery life and how fast it charges too! I’ve been using iPhone since it came out and MacBook but Apple Watch was something I didn’t think I needed. It’s not something you need, but it is well worth investing to make your life easier. Watch quality and size is perfect for my arm and it is durable and water resistance so I don’t have to worry about it while playing in the splash pad or parks too!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,"Amazing, my favorite purchase","Absolutely love this watch! It’s my first smart watch, so I decided to start with the SE and if I wanted to upgrade to the Series 9/10 I could later. But this little watch does everything I need it to. I don’t work out a lot, but I enjoy using it when I dance and go on walks. I like that you can text or answer calls quickly when you’re away from your phone. I have a very hands-on job, but the screen looks good, some scratches if you look reallly hard, but no large cracks. I also really like the starlight color, it’s a nice warmer silver that matches more of my outfits/jewelry. Vernal, very happy with it."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Daily watch,"I bought this watch over a year ago and I do love it. It tracks my activity, I can talk on the phone, text back, it will even find my phone if I lose it! The battery tends to die fairly quick. I have to charge it once a day. The color is pretty and is a very durable watch. All in all, I highly recommend the Apple Watch!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Great battery life and seamless integration!,"I recently acquired the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) with the Starlight Aluminum Case and Starlight Sport Band, and I must say it has been a game-changer for me. As a graduate student pursuing a master's in computer science at the University of Florida and a research assistant at the Learn Dialogue Lab, I needed a smartwatch that could seamlessly integrate into my active lifestyle, help me stay on top of my health, and even assist in my research tasks. The Apple Watch SE has exceeded my expectations in all these aspects.One of the standout features for me is the fitness and sleep tracking capabilities. With my busy schedule, it's crucial to keep tabs on my physical activity and sleep patterns. The Apple Watch SE does an excellent job of tracking my steps, calories burned, and even encourages me to move when I've been sitting for too long. The sleep tracking feature has been a revelation, providing insights into the quality of my sleep and helping me make adjustments for better rest.Being a tech enthusiast and someone deeply involved in the IT sector, I appreciate the crash detection and heart rate monitoring functions. Safety is paramount, and the watch's ability to detect a potential fall and initiate an emergency call is a reassuring feature, especially when I'm out traveling or in the middle of a research project. The heart rate monitor keeps me informed about my cardiovascular health during workouts and daily activities.As someone who loves teaching and mentoring, the Apple Watch SE also helps me manage my busy schedule. The calendar notifications and reminders keep me on track for meetings with my mentees and colleagues at the lab, which is essential for our collaborative projects, such as ""Collaborative sports,"" ""Amby: Language model for middle schoolers,"" and ""Integrate AI.""Moreover, the watch seamlessly integrates with my iPhone, allowing me to respond to messages, emails, and calls without taking out my phone, which is incredibly convenient during our frequent lab meetings and while I'm on the go.In conclusion, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) has become an indispensable part of my daily life. Its fitness and health-tracking features, coupled with its integration into my professional and academic activities, make it a must-have for anyone in the IT sector aiming to be a leader in future IT solutions. Whether I'm teaching React JS or exploring new states in the USA, this smartwatch has proven to be a reliable companion. Highly recommended!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,"Best watch for iOS users, it’s a no-brainer!","I was always a Fitbit user for my iPhone because I thought Apple Watch was too pricey for me. I started out with the Fitbit Blaze which was fine then upgraded to the first Sense watch which was junk. It finally died on me after only 3 years and the glue didn’t hold up so the face popped off. So I was in the market for a new smart watch.Finally broke down and bought this watch. Price for the SE was similar to the Fitbit.This is night and day!! If you’re on the fence about which one to choose, go with the Apple Watch!!The only downside is you have to charge it daily. You’ll get used to it. It’s fine, you’ll live.It’s beautiful, stylish but most of all you get all the features that mimics your phone. You’re not limited to the basics like you are with Fitbit. With the Apple Watch you can do it all so you get more bang for your buck. Don’t think on it. Just get this. It’s a no-brainer. Woot!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Nice and affordable watch,"I bought it for my wife and she’s happy with it.As many other customers say, the battery life is not the best. It can barely last for around 18 hours despite most of the background processes are turned off."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Authentic product,"I’ve had it for a few months now and it’s easy to set up, affordable and very convenient for me when i’m at work. I love the color and size of it too☺️"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Great apple watch,Bought this for my sister after we bough a used one that barely worked. This works perfect and my sister absolutely loves it. We got it for her birthday and she says it fits her perfect and works amazing. She said the battery life is great and it charges fine. My sister does manual labor and said the watch has taken a beating but doing really good. She loves it so much and it is a great product. I have grown fond of apple but still they need to work on some things haha.
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Great Watch,I bought this watch for my daughter & she loves it. It has alot of great features and works well with her Iphone. It's very user-friendly & the apps are easy to navigate. The battery works efficiently and last for a long time.
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Apple Watch/fitness tracker,I have had this watch for over a year super functional quality to watch is amazing. Very durable. I work out with all my wrist every day and don’t even know it’s on my wrist. Due to how it’s very lightweight and it charges super quick at night it’s charged within probably an hour.
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Watch Saver,"Well, my mom was out for a walk when she fell and the watch actually called 911! I didn’t know it would do this!  EMS came and cleaned her wounds up. That God for this watch!!!!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,I purchased a watch front  & back cover to keep it nicer.,I’m liking that I can change my watch bands. My other Apple Watch I could’t get the watch band on one side the button would not push in no how no way. I could actually set the watch up to my phone myself!
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Apple Watch accessories,Color is nice and great fit
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Perfect,Got this on sale and it’s perfect. My old watch broke and was so bummed until I found this perfect replacement
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,"It wakes me up in the morning by tapping my wrist, without waking up anyone else","My last watch the glass kind of chipped and started breaking so I figured to get a new watch.I think I went down as far as what features the Watch can do to this SE watch. But it still has the functions that I actually want. For example, it wakes me up when the alarm goes off; that way, it doesn’t wake up anyone else because it’s not beeping. It’s just tapping my wrist.I can also use the other functions that has such as answering the phone and answering texts. You can also check the weather and you can see the pictures that people sent you.There are really so many features to it that I’m not really sure that I would need the watch that has more features because this is really a good watch!I highly recommend this watch. It’s really good and it looks nice and the feature where it wakes me up without having to go off, but just tap my wrist, is the reason I actually bought this watch.I highly recommend this watch! you should get it!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Great gift,Got this as a gift and they loved it! Works well and looks very nice!
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,you have to charge it everyday,the battery does not last very long.
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Happy with watch,Happy with this watch. Has all the functions I need and use. A charge usually lasts me two days. Would buy again.
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Satisfied,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The only reason I ordered it from Amazon not the official website was because the price was lower. It arrived in a perfect condition. As for the product, I’m satisfied with it just like any other Apple products. I’ve had it for a month but I don’t wear it all day just because I don’t like having anything on my wrist. It’s mostly for workout purposes. The only thing I don’t approve of is the battery life. The battery runs out fast even when I leave it on a counter all day. But like I said, since I don’t wear it often. It doesn’t bother me too much."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Exactly what we wanted,"Ordered this watch as a replacement for an old watch. It was everything we needed and arrived in a timely manner. The watch is new and sealed, it paired fine with the phone."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,My daughter loves it,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas 2023, after her wearing it pretty much everyday for a year it's still going strong and works great. She loves it."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,"Love, love, love it","I am so happy with this watch. I should have gotten it sooner. All these years with a phone, I forgot how nice it is to hear have a watch. I love seeing the temperature at a glance, and what my next appointment is. I love the ease of health monitoring, controlling music playback, and receiving messages even if I’m not near my phone.I don’t care for the band, but there are endless replacement possibilities. I was thrown off by the USBC charger, but it’s no big deal now. I also bought normal-USB-compatible backup chargers for my car and my office. The charging speed is good. I bought a screen protector/cover and it’s already pretty banged up, so I’m glad I did."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,"Okay, I'm a convert","I really loved my Fitbit Luxe for its small size and stylish look. I didn't really need all the extras an Apple watch offers, and I didn't want to wear the big clunky Apple. But when Google took over and my last Fitbit died for the final time. it appeared that it really wasn't being supported any longer. Why did I wait so long? This watch is waaaay more than I really need, but I love it! There are lots of replacement bands available to lessen the utilitarian appearance."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Battery life,"It’s a pretty good item, the battery life just doesn’t last as long as I’d expect."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,3,It's OK,"This watch has some nice features: being able to receive emails and phone calls on it from your iPhone is very convenient, as is the sleep schedule/wind down feature. The wide choice of watch faces that show different information (or none at all if that's what you want) is nice to have.I had a Fitbit Charge 5 (which I opted not to replace when it died bc Fitbit seems to have reliability issues) & some of the features I loved about that watch were that it showed real-time info on your heart rate without having to click off to another screen, and it tracked SPO2 info, which this watch does not & you will have to buy a separate pulse oximeter. You will need to charge this watch every day, as opposed to every 4-5 days with a Fitbit. And the band that came with the watch kept popping off. I ended up buying a set of silicone watchbands from a third-party seller on Amazon that had a rectangular stud instead of a round one & that solved the popping-off problem.I'm still trying to figure out the Activity app on this watch bc i don't find it easy to follow & don't feel that it provides good real-time info on your activity levels, but maybe that's just bc I haven't figured it all out yet.It seems like this watch is really more for people who want the convenience of having a mini-iPhone on their wrist than for people who want to track their health and fitness."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Easier than going to the store.,"When my original Apple Watch started having problems, I thought I was going to have to go wait in store to buy a new watch but when I found this one on Amazon, I thought it would be too good to be true. This watch is exactly the same as what you would buy in store, but without the wait. I have always liked this Apple Watch because I've never needed the newest one. The functionality, sound quality, Watch quality, and weight were always some of my favorite things about it. I love that this one came with the more cream/rose colored band. But for work I usually just used my old band so I don’t damage the new one. If you want an Apple Watch at a good price and don’t need the newest one, I would suggest this one. I like the price of it a lot better too."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,1st time Apple Watch wearer!,And I love it!
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Great little watch except for one important thing,I’ve owned a couple of these Apple watches that are great products with the exception of one major problem. I have also purchased non-apple watches that cost much less that have had a much longer battery life than the Apple Watch. I don’t understand why the Apple Watch has a pathetic battery life wherein the much cheaper watches are Incredibly proficient in their battery life. The battery life for an Apple Watch is on the average is 24 hours wherein the other much less expensive non-Apple watches can go for days or even weeks. Shame on Apple.
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Fiance Loves It,"My fiance has never had a smart watch and she would often talk about how cool it would be. But she doesn't make a ton of money so it's always been a bit of a pipe dream. Well her birthday came around and this watch was at a great price, so I had to pick it up for her. She absolutely loves it. Perfect functionality. It's not too big, but still big enough to be useful.Personally I'm a Samsung guy and I've got a Galaxy Watch that I love, but she sure loves her Apple Watch and so far it appears to be a big winner."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Love it,"I wasn’t really a watch guy, or at least I wasn’t until recently. This watch has changed my life. It offers so many features that I can’t even begin to list them all. I’ve said this before, but it’s truly amazing. If you work out, run errands, use Apple Pay, or just want a convenient way to keep track of your time, this watch is for you. I highly recommend it. You won’t regret this purchase."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Love it but the battery dies way too fast,"I love the product. However, the battery dies way too fast within one day even if I’m not using it. I would say it lasts me about a good 5-6 hrs. Need to charge it every day."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Watch,Nice watch however I’m still trying to figure some things out. I had a Fitbit  versa 2 prior to this Apple Watch.Seems like my text messages are not received by my phone. Maybe I need a new iPhone I’m still using my old 11. And the battery life does dwindle quick. Otherwise it’s a super cute watch and has many options. I did talk on it and was able to answer my phone on the watch and the sound was awesome. 😎
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Love Love,"Wanted to start out with a cheaper version of the watch to make sure I really like it. And I love it! I use it mostly for fitness and checking important notifications when I don't have my phone nearby. I also love the sleep tracker and the heart rate monitor. I see the other features that come with the other apple watch such as the airfib, which this one doesn't have. But I believe this is a good starter watch for those who may have never owned a smart watch like this. Then in the future you can upgrade if necessary."
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Bought in Prime Days n Worth It,"I’ve been eye balling these watches for awhile. When I saw the pricing on this one during Amazon Prime Days I bought it. No regrets really. I like that it measures how many calories I’ve burnt at the gym, being able to talk to someone while I’m busy working without having to hold my phone. It also is an easy reference for checking notifications whether texts or prompts from sources I’ve chosen. The watch does charge fast as it will lose battery life if worn all day"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Does the job,Received this watch & has everything I need to monitor my lifestyle. I wish the battery would last longer & didn’t have to charge it so often
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Love This Watch,I purchased this watch to replace my series 4. I have really small wrists so the watch was the same size as my series 4. I do like the color of the band but I only wear the original band for a short time because it does get dirty fast.
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,4,Battery life,Love the watch itself but battery life is less than 24 hrs. Not ideal
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Perfect and Affordable!,"I’ve been steadily growing my collection of Apple products, and always had the Apple Watch on my list. The SE is the perfect buy for anyone looking for a sleek, stylish, and functional smartwatch at a fair price. It is compatible with the latest iOS and has all of the application features I was looking for (and then some)! Plus it has loads of cute watch faces to choose from - you can even easily switch between faces by adding them to your “Favorites.” All-in-all I’m very happy with my purchase!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Really good!,"The delivery was delayed, but the watch is really good!"
B0CHX7R6WJ,Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 40mm GPS,5,Nice,Great watch for the money. Goes with most of wife's outfits and she appreciates the fitness tracker.
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Rebel T7 Camera,I have enjoyed this camera for the month that I have had it. It takes super clean photos. I bought a sports lens for it and it works really well on shooting sports mode. The shutter speed is perfect. Its the perfect camera for beginners or even more experienced photographers. Also the cost for this camera is very affordable.
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,It is a great package but a buy a new neck strap if you can,"I’m an amateur photographer. I do senior pictures for fellow students and family portraits. The quality is amazing it’s easy enough to use point click and the flash works fantastic. The extra light I’ve set up as an exterior light for some photo projects and it’s worked fantastically. The tripod works in any ground pretty much with the help of a small level on the top of it. If I’m on a hill and I wanna know if it’s straight it works perfectly. The lenses are great! Perfect condition when the arrived, they are exactly what I wanted and what a steal! The UV lens is perfect for super gloomy days I think. It makes them look a little brighter in my opinion less bleh. Which is always nice. The bag it comes with is sturdy no tears no holes! The dividers are movable. You can take them out and switch them around! Which is nice since I’m always switching out the stuff I need for work! It has a million pockets to fit everything you need! The lenses have small pouches and covers to put on and in when you’re not using them. Handy indeed! The two SD cards work great! It has a little wallet like case for them that can attach to the cameras strap for easy convenient use! It does not has an extra battery for the camera however! It charges super fast in an hour and a half (1hr 30 mins) usually it’ll be fully charged! It’s also WiFi enabled! Meaning if you ya ether cannon app you can use your camera remotely through the app! You can also download pictures from it and tag locations you’ve shot at! Super handy!!!! The small clicker you can hook up on the side of camera is great! It works great! It’s very short however. Use only when working with nervous kids so they don’t see you take the picture! The pocket tripod isn’t that useful for me personally but maybe a smaller vlogger or general YouTuber could find it useful it’s only about 5 inches high but it’s super sturdy! The camera might look to big but it holds up great! I use the strap it’s semi comfortable it needs broken in but I don’t recommend it. It’s rough around the edges of it but still usable. I’m ordering a better strap because I use it often and my neck will hurt after shooting for 4-5 hours.Overall great package! Super useful and great for amateurs or people starting out with Cannon!"
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Great first DSLR camera!,"This is the first DSLR I’ve used, so I only have past point and shoots and my phone to compare it to- I’m very impressed! My TA helped me pick out this model/set to start with as I needed a DSLR for my photo class and I was lost as to what to get. I’ve been using this camera and the various inclusions for the past couple of weeks, and it has really aided in improving my photos. There are quite a few things I haven’t used yet (like the filters) but the SD cards, reader, tripods, and bag have all been helpful. In fact, I found the included “Photo4Less” bag to be a little too big for my daily use. It will definitely hold a lot of extra accessories inside of it alongside the camera and kit lens. However, for my purposes, I went ahead and purchased another smaller bag for walking around town/campus with. The included bag would probably be good for traveling though.I found the seller of this bundle, Photo4Less, to be good. I received all my items on my estimated arrival date (fast shipping with prime) and nothing was damaged or not working properly. Overall, if you’re a beginner like me, I think this is a good camera bundle to start with."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Good camera,"It is not a professional camera, but does well as it is"
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,4,"Great camera, easy to use but needs a power cord.","I bought this camera to take photos of jewelry I'm going to be selling and for family events. It's pretty easy to use. It comes with a lot of stuff that I probably won't ever need, but they are nice to have anyway. I think it is a good value. The only thing that bothers me is that it depends so much on the battery being charged. There is no power cord to plug into a wall socket so that you can shoot table-top objects without the battery. You have to rely on the battery all the time. It can get tedious remembering ""Oh yeah, I need to charge the battery — AGAIN"". Down time. I was able to download photos into my Macintosh (which is 8 years old) without the battery being charged. That being said, you can't charge the battery while it's in the camera from the computer. I do like the quality of the photos and even though it comes with the two extra lenses, the one it comes with is very good. Overall, I am happy with this purchase. Just wish it came with a power cord."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Canon camera,In love with this camera I have been wanting a camera for years and never followed through with it if you are looking for a good first camera with good qualities 100% recommend
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Reliable camera.  Nice picture quality and easy for a novice to use.,"This is the 3rd Canon Rebel I have owned.  I had one before the era of digital cameras and then I purchased my first digital version 12 years ago.  My 12 year old very outdated Canon Rebel was still taking good pictures but the lag time and some other issues had me looking to finally upgrade to a newer version.  After reading reviews, I decided to go with the T6 and the package deal offered here on Amazon.This camera is everything I expected it to be.  An upgraded and better version of my older one.  All of my Canon lens and my Canon Flash attachment can be interchanged.  I still haven't had a chance to figure out how the Wi-Fi features works but will get to that feature shortly.I am strictly a novice photographer. I really have no idea how to use any of the manual settings.  This camera helps a novice feel more like a pro.  The quality of the pictures is impressive.  I highly recommend this camera for anyone that enjoys photography but may feel a bit intimidated by some of the more complex and expensive SLR cameras.  This camera is easy enough for anyone to figure out.I also recommend this package.  Although I won't use everything that was included, the memory cards, the UV filters ,and the two screw on lens attachments make it worth purchasing the bundle.  As for the UV filter it's good to use just to protect your camera. Sometimes I remove itbefore taking a picture and then screw it back on when I am finished. It's a great extra layer of protection."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Stay on Point,"I needed a reliable camera for my newest project, but my budget was tight. Gathered a few opinions, did some minimal research and happened upon this gem. Its size and ease of use, is only challenged by the many options for capturing an image exactly how you want it to be presented. I have to start setting regular down time periods because snapping photos can get addictive real fast and become borderline annoying to my family members😂"
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,4,Very Good overall,"Really easy to use, it brought so many things! I was a bit worried that it wasnt going to be delivered on time but it did, I guess it was a very difficult time due to high demand on Christmas."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,3,Rebel T7 Camera,Camara has been good so far. But noticed from the description that the 0.43x Auxiliary Wideangle Lens come in the package. But the package I received is missing it. I would like to know if the seller will be sending it separately or will I be getting reimbursed for the missing item which was listed as what comes with the package. I am happy with the camera and picture quality but I am not happy about the missing item since I have paid for this camera and everything that comes with it. I would recommend ordering with caution.
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Great,"Still learning how to operate it effectively and with the multiple lenses and filters, I feel spoiled for choice. But it's been great so far. I have found that it's not worth the hassle of connecting your phone through WiFi to export pictures. Just use the memory card and an adapter for the phone or the given USB adapter for PC."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,4,Capturing Moments with Excellence,"I recently invested in a Canon camera, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, delivering exceptional performance and capturing moments with unparalleled clarity.The image quality is outstanding, thanks to the advanced technology packed into this camera. Whether shooting in low light or bright sunlight, the Canon camera consistently produces sharp, vibrant images with incredible detail.

It ensures that I never miss a moment, especially when capturing fast-paced scenes or spontaneous shots. The ability to customize focus points adds an extra layer of control, catering to both beginners and seasoned photographers.The camera's ergonomic design and intuitive controls make it a pleasure to use. The menu system is user-friendly, allowing easy navigation and quick access to a plethora of features. The build quality is robust, providing durability without compromising on portability.I appreciate the versatility of this camera. Whether I'm exploring photography or videography, it delivers outstanding results. The video quality is top-notch, with smooth and cinematic footage that adds a professional touch to my projects.The Canon camera's connectivity options, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, simplify the process of transferring and sharing images. Once I was able to figure out how to get it to actually connect to my Wi-Fi, it seamlessly integrates with various devices and applications, enhancing the overall user experience.In conclusion, the Canon camera has become an indispensable tool in my creative journey. Its exceptional image quality, rapid autofocus, and user-friendly design make it a standout choice for both enthusiasts and professionals. If you're in the market for a reliable and high-performing camera, Canon undoubtedly delivers on its promise of excellence."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,4,Camera bag to small for camera and accessories,"Returning the photography after many years, this camera seems to be an awesome way to start. The only drawback in my opinion is the camera bag is too small for the camera and the accessories that come with in this bundle."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,4,Spectacular,"My camera arrived in Jamaica fast, all accessories came that were listed, picture quality is good the autofocus sometimes takes a while to focus but all in all the battery hold a decent charge and the camera is easy to use."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Charger - EURO Plug,"The charger that was with this camera was not compatible with the wall plug here in the US.  Had to order a new charger in order charge the battery.  Other than that, this was a great value."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Good quality camera set up!,I bought this for my son to use in his school photography class. He will be using this quality camera for a long time.
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,3,"Less than $20 worth of extra ""lenses"".","So the piece that attracted me to this package versus the other Canon packages on Amazon was the 3 included lenses. I should have known better. It DOES come with the 1 Canon kit lens. The other 2 lenses are XIT brand and the two of them together can be purchased for less than $20. They actually make the pictures worse. Also, just to note, these are not stand alone lenses. They screw onto the front of the lens like a filter would. These are completely not usable for any kind of quality pictures. An average point and shoot camera takes higher quality pictures than you will get through these lenses.If this is your first DSLR, the kit provides a decent value. All of the components are cheap, but will give you an idea if those are things you will use and should replace with better versions.The camera itself is (so far) awesome. The camera alone would have been a 5 star purchase. The package alone would be a 2 star purchase. The way it's listed and pictured is deceptive. Overall, it's worth the $10 over just the camera, but be sure to keep your expectations low.All the included components are as follows:$10.69 xit macro lens xt58wab$8.93 xit telephoto lens xt2x58$19.75 vivitar large gadget bag$22.46 xit tripod xt60trb$4.50 vivitar 4in pocket tripod$9.16 transcend 16gb flash card$16.99 transcend 32gb flash card$8.68 xit remote shutter release$4.93 xit SD/microSD card reader$7.46 pro series digital filter set$3.95 lens cap keeper (stick on)$2.94 xit universal screen protector$3.99 xit digital ultraviolet filter$3.00 vivitar cleaning kit and card wallet$14.95 slave flashTotal accessories: $142.38$449 Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera Kit with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Lens (Black)"
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,3,Camera is great. Don't get the Bundle.,"The camera is great, 5 stars. The accessories are cheap and not worth the getting the bundle. Just buy the base kit and buy quality accessories separately."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,"Great value, Good Package, not all ""Canon"" equipment","Based on the fact that this package was $100 less than any other store (including retail and wholesale conventional stores), I was very concerned that there would be some sneaky practice involved such as swapping out the Canon lens that comes in the standard kit and replacing it with a cheaper lens. So far as far as I can tell, there is no such trickery. All of the items are packed in one big box as one item. Mine came in an additional outer amazon box. If that is surely the case there is absolutely no reason to buy this camera anywhere else, especially if you have Prime. I personally ordered it on Tuesday and it arrived on Thursday even though it was only guaranteed by Friday.As you might suspect everything except the camera kit itself (body, 1 lens, neckstrap, etc.) are not Canon brand. As shown in the picture the memory cards are transcend, and the rest is a blend between a few brands, mostly Vivitar and Xit Photo (the brand for the additional two lenses). I am not as qualified as I would like to be to comment on the quality of the two additional lenses, and so will update this review once I have a true photographer friend check them out.As for the camera itself, the big disappointment thus far has been the ""Wi-fi"" capability. We were upgrading from a Rebel T1, and the majority of the functions for this camera are the same and work great. If you bought this you were looking for an entry-level DSLR, and that is exactly what you get. The Wi-Fi function however is fairly horrendous. Yes, TECHNICALLY you can upload photos directly from the camera to a certain set of web services (including google drive which is my choice), but not without first installing software on your PC and/or phone and going through a complicated set up process. Once you have all that set up you quickly find there is no way to simply ""upload all"" photos from your camera, but you have to select and send them one by one. The only possible exception to this is the Canon service itself which I have no intention of using. I have not tried photos set up for HDR yet, but I am relatively sure it will have a hard time for that as it wasn't even advertised.Everything else about this camera is great, and the wife loved unpacking all the accessories. So far every item I have tested has worked great (the two memory cards, the memory card reader, the lens cap saver thingy, tripod. So many little things in here she didn't know she needed. I will update this review as I use more items or have relevant information."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Easy to use,As advertised
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Perfect DSLR camera for starters,"Absolutely the best. Always loved canon cameras, and this bundle came with everything !"
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,4,"Beginner, feels good to use","I've used digital cameras before, but never anything like this. The ease of use is really good for a beginner, though I do have to look some things up to figure it out as I go. The kit feels like it comes with a lot of unnecessary extras that I don't see myself using, and the tripod it came with arrived broken so that's a bit disappointing. The extra lenses it came with seem pretty good so far, I'm excited to get out and use it for my upcoming traveling.The case it comes with is also a bit small, but it does fit the extra lenses, remote switch, the filters, SD card holder, USB , battery charger with the extra battery and the cleaning accessories so I suppose I can't complain much. It's just a really tight fit is all."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Very good quality,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I am a beginner photographer and I have to say if you are looking to start photography this is the camera and kit you should get. The weight and battery life are really good. It was really easy to learn how to use it and switch the lens, the auto focus is really good. I haven’t had a change to check the WiFi connectivity but I will"
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,"Amazing Camera, ""Okay"" bundle","The camera is 5 stars quality but the bundle makes it 2 stars. Using cell phones to take picture's really had me thinking I was a bit of a natural and worse, a professional photographer. However, I've had expensive camera's before by Kodak and Nikon and they were easy to use when I brought them. I LOVE taking photo's and scrap booking  family so, I thought I should buy a good camera to make my photo's look better. I also brought the T6 because of the name ""rebel."" Silly idea. I opened the camera and I thought I could just cut it on and you have to charge a battery and then add a battery AND the like memory card. And its not like you can just take a picture and then edit the exposure, brightness and so on. You have to like master the settings and read the manual before you can do anything. My brother had a friend come over with his T6I and he helped me with the settings so I could take basic photo's. He told me to keep my setting in 'program' and he set me up in the 'raw' format.  The reviews said the lens and flash are not compatible with the T6 so, I have a lot of things I can't use until I take a class or buy a book for Dummies. I mostly take photo's of people but, I brought the bundle to use the lens to take picture's of nature, the sun, tree's and flowers or sky scrapers so the lens are a disappointment. The camera itself is so amazing, I look forward to spending money on quality lens. The camera itself is 5 stars. I am a beginner and I see the different in quality. As a beginner, right now, I use app's to edit my photo's, not the camera. But, I love the way people seem to 'pop' out in photo's and how natural light looks with this camera.The order came really faster and I expected it much later. The package was set up perfectly and maybe its not the camera and its me. Cells phones have me all messed up but, I learned how to edit pictures with cell phone app's so maybe it will help me later"
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,3,Unsure about value of this,Off brand lenses.  Littlest camera bag I ever saw/more like a makeup bag. Not sure if I am keeping this.
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,4,Piece of bundle missing,Although it is minor the description says there are supposed to be 2 SD cards but I only received 1. I would give 4.5.
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,3,"Forget the ""Bundle""",As expected since the camera is a new version of a much used older camera - the camera is great and very advanced over its predecessor. But the non-canon Bundle with it is pretty unhelpful and low quality.
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I am not a professional photographer but did have a Nikon camera years ago before DSLRs came out and basically taught myself photography. Nothing special, and mainly used the Auto function. This camera has taken the place of that Nikon Dinasaur and I like it as much as the Nikon. The pictures come out so clear and clean. I am flabbergasted at the price of special lenses, but I will save up for some that I want. The auto-focus works perfectly. Very easy to learn on. And you can't go wrong with the price. I guess if I had to say how this kit could be improved, would be if the kit had different lenses other than the ones that came with the kit. But then, that would jack the price up on the total kit.HIGHLY recommend, regardless."
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,I’m a Canon Fan,Thanks to circumstances beyond my control my camera swam in the ocean! This camera came to the rescue!!! I had a couple of jobs lined up and this is so good and so easy to work!!!The pictures were amazing thanks to a great camera!
B01D93Z89W,Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR Camera Bundle,5,Perfect starter kit,Great kit with everything you need to get started with photography. Absolutely great!
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,Amazing laptop for an astoundingly low price,"Very powerful laptop, beautiful screen, perfect size for more demanding work, great battery life, checks all the boxes for a professional work laptop.I ordered through Amazon Renewed that was marked as ""acceptable"" and this laptop is literally in perfect condition, not a scratch on it. As far as I can tell, this laptop was opened, held on to for a short time, and returned. I will definitely be looking to buy from Amazon Renewed in the future."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,Best laptop I had,"The SAMSUNG 14” Galaxy Book4 Pro Laptop is a sleek and powerful device that delivers excellent performance for both work and play. Its compact size and lightweight design make it highly portable, perfect for on-the-go use. The vibrant display offers crisp and clear visuals, ideal for multimedia consumption and productivity tasks.Under the hood, the laptop is equipped with robust hardware, ensuring smooth multitasking and fast processing speeds. The battery life is commendable, lasting through a full day of moderate use. Additionally, the build quality is solid, and the keyboard provides a comfortable typing experience. Overall, the Galaxy Book4 Pro is a great choice for those seeking a high-quality, portable laptop."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,1,Computer is dead after two months and there are no repair options from Samsung,"I bought a Samsung laptop because I stupidly thought it would be more reliable and have better service than a Dell. The network has stopped working, Samsung tech-support is completely worthless, my options are: (1) send it in for repair with a two week turnaround time or (2) travel to Texas or California. Of course they know that nobody can be without a computer for two weeks so there you go, the warranty is as worthless as ****. I’m sticking with iPhones and never again by a Samsung product."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,"Slim, powerful and beautiful screen, for me a five-star laptop 2024.","Slim and powerful, the Galaxy Book 4 Pro has a beautiful, vivid screen, a fast 120 Hz refresh rate, an all-aluminum solid build, and AI capabilities with a copilot button. The laptop has a good keyboard. However, it is hot during battery charge. The hardware is the key for the Business Version: Intel core ultra -155h CPU, new iris GPU, extended battery, 1 Tb SSD. However, if you increase the brightness and the energy consumption of the apps installed, particularly for the antivirus, it will reduce the battery duration. Finally, for the first time with a laptop, I could quickly set it up, but with slow driver updates."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,4,"Excellent Build Quality, Very DIY Friendly For Easy Storage Capacity Upgrades, Not Price Competitive","The 2024 Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 14 inch has one of the most premium builds for a Windows Laptop in its class in my opinion. It's very light-weight (2.7 lbs) and easy to throw in a backpack or carry in a suitcase. Aesthetically it looks very sleek, professional, and has ultraportable functionality. In terms of design & build quality, it's a worthy Windows competitor to the Apple MacBook Air M2 & M3. I'm an on the go professional that works in the Construction, Engineering, & Architecture space and this is a laptop I’d feel comfortable using to conduct client presentations.I was able to attain the 1 TB SSD, 16 GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro, Core Ultra 7 Version (NP944XGK-KG1US) for $999 due to a pricing error on Amazon. For the price I attained it at - this was a great deal and that's why it's getting 4 stars from me. Currently, the same business version I bought is currently ""normally"" retailing for $1749 on Amazon & Samsung Directly. I needed this version as this is my work laptop as well. For that premium price, I believe there are significant cheaper alternatives available from PC competitors that offer way more bang for your buck for similar or even better specs.That being stated, I will start off my review with the positives:1) The 3K AMOLED screen on this laptop is gorgeous. Colors really pop & make for great video streaming.2) Really Easy DIY m.2 storage upgrades (I was able to upgrade storage from 1 TB to 8 TB) - Getting access to the motherboard to replace the OEM m.2 ssd and add my own took me literally less than 20 minutes with the help of YouTube tutorials + a Cheap $10 PC Tool Kit.3) 2 Thunderbolt 4 Ports, 1 HDMI 2.1 Port (that can run 8k), 1 USB-A Legacy Port, and 1 MicroSD slot.4) Fantastic Build Quality & Ultraportable - a true Windows Built Design rival to an Apple Designed Product.5) Some special integrated ""Samsung Only"" features if you're especially invested in the Samsung Eco-System (w/ Galaxy Smart Phone, Quickshare, Smartthings, etc).6) Intel Unison Software allows call, text message, and image retrieval compatibility with iPhones & iPads.7) Keyboard comes with the new Microsoft Copilot Key integrated & a dedicated ai NPU chip.8) Intel ARC Graphics (much, much better than Intel XE Graphics of the past several years).9) Intel Evo Certified.10) Comes w/ Windows 11 Pro (on the NP944XGK version) – which is handy for integration with my company’s data servers & Microsoft Azure AD network.11) Battery Life runs at 8 hours (with full brightness and performance set to maximum with constant load with two m.2 ssd's). I imagine many more hours if you reduce brightness, performance, and are running the stock OEM SSD.12) Fast Charging.Some of the negatives:1) While I got this for a great price, the normal consumer price of over $1749 is way too high for what you're getting with this Laptop especially when benchmarked with other Windows PC competition.2) The 14 inch "" Pro"" version is capped to a maximum of Soldered 16 GB RAM in the US, Canada, and UK.3) The OEM SSD that the laptop comes installed with is not from Samsung, it's an entry-level Western Digital m.2 SN740 NVMe 1 TB SSD which you can find new from IT suppliers for $50-70. The upcharge from 512 GB version to the 1 TB version of this laptop is $300 (Samsung is conducting Apple-Level price gouging but unlike Apple it’s not even using their own top tier in-house parts).4) Competitor Models from Lenovo and Asus offer similar or even better specs for $500-700 less e.g.  the 2024 Lenovo Slim 7i Gen 9 comes 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, Core Ultra 7, a similar poppy OLED screen, better battery life, and svelte durable light-weight design body, all of which can be attained for under $1000.5) The ""cheapest"" version of the 14-inch version laptop is $1449 and that only comes with a Core Ultra 5, 512 GB SSD, and 16 GB RAM which is a shame in 2024.6) Bezels of the screen aren't terrible but they could've been smaller especially given premium pricing (e.g. Lenovo Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, Dell XPS 14).7) Same Design as Last Year's 2023 Galaxy Book3 14 Pro.8) A small nitpick, but this laptop is only available in one color scheme in the US. It's nice...but c'mon Samsung....Some Redemption:I will say that one of the most redeeming aspects of this laptop despite its negatives primarily associated with its pricing, is the fact that this has TWO m.2 NVMe slots (rare in a laptop of this size). I love that Samsung made it super easy and uncomplicated to get access to the motherboard. Theoretically, you could DIY upgrade this to having potentially 16 TB (yes TB!) of storage space in your laptop if you can run two m.2 8 TB drives. Might cost as much as the laptop itself, but it is indeed possible. I'm currently running two Samsung 990 Pro SSD's with 4 TB each (8 TB total). Cloning the OEM drive was super easy with Samsung's Magician Software.And ultimately, I must give kudos to Samsung on this feature - this has to be the standout feature on this laptop in my opinion and saves me from having to carry a portable SSD for extra data. If only they could've sold the 32 GB RAM version for the 14-inch Pro in America....Finally, for professional and business network/software reasons, I'm forced to be a Windows User and this is a good option for that. My only hesitation is that for its current market price, I think there are frankly better Windows options that offer more for less pricing wise (Lenovo Slim 7i Gen 9, Asus Zenbook UX3405) and the same pricing bracket for more (Dell XPS 14, Lenovo Thinkbook Gen13x Gen 4).If I paid the normal price, I’d be giving this review 3.5 stars.Alas I got a good deal, so whom am I to complain? :)"
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,3,"Sweet looking, but terrible keyboard","I was trying out a number of computers for work and this was one of them. It's a nice laptop, good internals, solid build, overall it looks nice and runs well. It is a bit heavy and the build is essentially a copy of the Macbook Air.The whole reason why I would not recommend this laptop is because of the keyboard. Typing on this is absolutely terrible. Gave me the ick by typing on it. After spending a day with it I knew this was a terrible keyboard.I ended up going with the Zenbook Duo 2024 from ASUS. Great laptop, highly recommended."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,Excellent work computer,"A couple years back, my mom gifted me an Alienware laptop since my Omen's screen was acting up, and it's served me well as both a work computer and gaming laptop but the thing is definitely a bit on the heftier side lol.At any rate, I actually came across this laptop while browsing for an upgrade for my Samsung tablet. This was definitely one of those ""impulse purchases but it's for work"" kind of things lol. But at the end of the day, I'm very happy with the Galaxy Book 4 pro. It's smaller and weighs a fraction of what my Alienware does. It performs well and is extremely portable. The built-in webcam is high enough quality that I can use it for my work video calls.This particular laptop was sold at a discount as ""used like new"" - one of the 2 manufacturer sticker seals on the box had been partly torn but not opened completely, and the other was untouched. As far as I can tell, the box had never actually been opened, so it seems like I got a pretty solid discount for just some minor packaging damage lol.I can't speak to its gaming capabilities. I haven't tried to play anything on the Galaxy Book - I'm sure I have a couple games on Steam that it could handle, but as I mentioned, I have a gaming laptop - This one is basically for everything else, from personal projects to all my work stuff!I've been a fan of Samsung for a long time, but this is my first computer purchase from this brand and I'm definitely sold! This laptop is lightweight and highly portable, and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a solid machine for work or school."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,2,The battery life is not as advertised,"The battery is not as good as was said in the information. In using it now for about 3 months I have discovered that the battery will only hold a charge for about 4-5 hours at best. I am very unhappy with this. The screen is crisp, colors are bright. Speed is good also. But the battery will not be able to hold a charge for 12 or 15 hours as is in the info. I only do my banking, check email, have a few word docs, and some other items. I am not a gamer nor do I have multiple tabs open at one time. I also do not have a lot of apps on my computer. If I were to fly to Hawaii the computer would be dead upon arrival. Very disappointing and not worth the money."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,4,Solid laptop,"Solid laptop. Could be better in some areas, especially for the price, but overall I'm happy with it.Pros:- Excellent build quality with no creaks anywhere, although there's a little bit of screen wobble- Gorgeous display that gets plenty bright for indoor use. Scrolling is very smooth thanks to the 120hz refresh rate and you get those deep blanks thanks to the panel being OLED- Light for a 16incher- Great CPU performance. Very snappy with minimal fan noise even under heavy load, although it can get kinda hot in the space above the keyboard after awhile. Can't comment on GPU performance since I don't play games, although I imagine a dedicated gaming laptop with a dedicated graphics card would be better if you're a hardcore gamer.- Samsung integrations. I have a bunch of other Samsung products like the Galaxy S24, Tab S8, and Buds2 Pro and I appreciate the integrations between the laptop and these other products. I probably won't be using most of them but they're still nice to have. The most convenient ones for me have been the Buds auto-switching, Samsung Notes, Quick Share, and Second Screen.- Fingerprint reader works greatCons:- Keyboard. It's not a bad keyboard, it's just meh. The key travel is pretty shallow. Also all the keys are off-center thanks to the number pad on the right which messes with my muscle memory. Will take some getting used to.- Battery Life. Haven't been able to get more than about 5 hours of screen on time even with light use (web browsing and streaming). Might just need to wait about a week for all the optimizations to take place, but I'm hoping it gets better.- Speakers. Not the worst speakers, just meh. Could be better for the price. Turning on Dolby Atmos makes a noticeable improvement, but I've had much cheaper laptops with better speakers. Will definitely be using my earbuds most of the time."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,4,"Pretty good hardware, bad linux support","I'm going to be returning it mainly because it is poorly supported on Linux. Webcam and speakers don't work out of the box. If that doesn't apply to you, then I could still very much recommend this laptop (especially on sale, I got a few hundred off).The hardware is very nice. The screen is pretty and I'm just totally spoiled on smooth high refresh rates. Battery life is acceptable, though still doesn't really match Apple silicon. There's an extra M.2 slot inside, which is actually really nice. If you need more storage, don't bother buying the overpriced 1 TB upgrade. Just buy any M.2 SSD you want and slap it in. Speakers are not quite as nice and thumpy as those of a Macbook Pro, but I mean who is really out here trying to get a high quality media experience on laptop speakers."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,2,Very buggy and slow,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this laptop with the intention of primarily studying and working on coding projects while being able to take advantage of the Samsung ecosystem. However, I've found that the computer randomly gets incredibly laggy when there are few to no programs running in background. I have tried restarting, checking for any driver updates, malware detection, and troubleshooting guidelines. It becomes unbearable when even my music on spotify starts freezing and lagging. Writing this review on this laptop itself was quite annoying as well (see the lag in attached video).I bought this laptop less than 3 weeks ago on Cyber Monday and the sheer number of bugs it has compared to my old 2018 Macbook Pro has made it a pretty regretful purchase for me. I normally do not write reviews but my negative experience in such a short amount of time has been very frustrating.Even with most of my devices being Samsung, I would not recommend this product for the ecosystem nor do I think it even contributes much to it. My Galaxy Buds 3pro rarely connect, Quick Share doesn't work most the time, and Samsung Flow definitely does not feel very flowy."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,It's good overall,"I've been using it for half a year now.I think everything is good, except it has a serious overheating problem. Kinda hard to put it on your leg.I do love the touch screen, performance is average. Pretty light weight."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,3,"On surface awesome, but lots of issues","I have always liked Samsung products.  I have a Samsung phone and watch and love them both.  So the specs on the laptop were great and the price was good.  Despite seeing a warning of lots of returns on this laptop, I purchased it.  It is a very thin, light, and powerful laptop but had so many issues, sent it back.  The BIOS was faulty as it did not recognize the TPM and thus Windows had issues.  It kept asking for the BitLocker code after ever reboot.  Then every time you click Shutdown in Windows, it just rebooted so to shut down had to do a hard reboot.  I am in IT and spent hours troubleshooting all to no avail and sent it back.  Great product, but just a fair warning on the consistent quality and usage.Update, there are places on the Internet, including Samsung's site, that says Windows 11 Pro will work on this laptop - it does not.  It requires TPM 2.0 and this laptop does NOT have TPM.  I confirmed that with 2 Samsung engineers today when Windows 11 Pro would not install."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,4,Camera doesn't work,"Pretty good laptop, but camera doesn't work for my zoom calls"
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,4,"Slim, nice quality","I haven't gotten to use this much yet, but so far my only complaint is that there is no built in web cam...which I didn't realize before purchase."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,Excellent as expected,"All specs & weight are as announced, weight is 1.56Kg without the charger, touch screen is very responsive same as galaxy tabs, Samsung apps are good additional to windows. Could play shadow of the tomb raider with 1080p high setting at 33 FPS,  Ratchet & Clank rift apart with 720p medium setting, even I played ""Red dead redemption"" at 720p low setting. The issues are: the body is easy to be scratched, I'm going to buy a laptop cover, If you want to setup a fresh copy of windows, you have to be expert to bypass the WIFI definition, windows will not recognize the touch pad/keyboard/touchscreen in the start of the setup and you have to backup the drivers came with the original windows, drivers in the Samsung web site were not working for me (I don't know why). After all, I'm happy to have this product."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,3,Heating issues.,"The laptop has decent specs, but it heats up way to fast just on standby."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,4,Works fine,I don't know about laptops but I expected alot mote technology coming from a new Samsung product.
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,3,Bad battery,Kind of expected it but battery only lasted 2-4 hours depending on the activity. Otherwise good product but had to send it back because it was a dealbreaker.
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,3,Great looking but quality,"I returned the one bought. It's a nice looking and looks like a quality built. However, when get the using it needs work. It comes with a lot bloat ware. One I purchased had updating issue and just wouldn't update. It keeps restarting but yet wouldn't update. The track pad is super loud and some areas wasn't responsive at all. The battery is horrible, at least on the one I purchased. Samsung make some good smart phones why can't they produce quality laptops as well. A MacBook air will do you better. This is from someone that would prefer to buy a Samsung laptop over Apple. But Samsung have left a bad taste in my mouth."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,I couldn't be happier with this laptop,"After being user of Dell XPS for the last 8 years, I decided to change to this one. To me, I won't go back to Dell. Very fast, light, with all the ports that you need to get things done and still very thin. Very good image quality and 16"" screen makes a difference!"
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,Beast of a laptop. Amazing for its price.,"Samsung should definitely consider upgrading the integrated GPU to a dedicated NVIDIA or AMD one so it sells more. Am a casual gamer but use this laptop primarily for work/coding etc. The price is quite high but for a touchscreen laptop, $1200 is a steal. Its an incredibly good deal for a 16inch laptop with such power. However, only being limited to 16GB of ram is really a pain. Worse part is that its soldered to the motherboard and you can't even upgrade! 16GB of RAM in 2024 is a real pain."

B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,Easy to use!,I love this laptop!  It is easy to use and love the fact there is an area that has the number to the right like a regular computer keyboard.  Beautiful screen!
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,2,It's okay...,"The screen is amazing which is the only positive thing for this laptop. Battery life is abysmal, it needs to be plugged in at all times and I have it set to 60Hz instead of 120. I may have to reset it to get rid of all the samsung bloatware and see if that will improve battery life. The cooling is pretty bad too. The fan is loud and the keyboard becomes kind of hot."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,Excellent laptop!,"This is the second 14-inch laptop I have bought from Samsung. My previous laptop also was from Samsung. I use it for work every day and for travel. I like that this laptop is light and that the design is beautiful. I was afraid to buy it online. Usually, I purchase such expensive items in a retail store, but stores don't carry this model.It was fine. The packaging was good. And Amazon Prime delivered it within 24 hours."
B0CQ3VXJ3J,Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop,5,VERY PLEASED WITH THE SAMSUNG GALAXY BOOK 4,This is a very high quality PREMIUM PRICED product primarily for those who are SAMSUNG enthusiasts such as myself.

B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,It is just ok orginally but now two months later really good choice,"My orginal review was correct but after getting things set up the way that I want, it is a great actvity tracker.1. Battery Life is amazing! If you are like me you hate when you are working out and the watch dies not recoding the steps or activities. This watch will last for 7 days2. The app is easy to use- If you are serious about measuring your activity great way to see how you are doing for the last several days, weeks, months...3. It measures what I care about steps and activityThe watch is not for you if you want-1. seeing emails and texts (not a strong feature)2. Trying to use it to answer callsI change my three stars to five stars after using it for awhile. The band and the orginal watch setup was not well designed but you can order a band for $10 and change the watch screen (use google to search how to do it, it is not hard but not obvious).The amazing battery life was what pushed it to 5 stars.Orginal Review-I had a Versa 2 and really liked it. I have very basic usages-steps, activity and as a watch. It did a wonderful job. It died and so I bought the Versa 4. 1. the watch ban is cheap!! the versa 2 was nothing great but this one is awful. (so i will have to buy another one to replace the one that comes with it). 2. the new watch face trys to do too much. KISS should have been there moto Keep it simple stupid. 3 the sync with the app seems to be off. I just got it so it just might take more time to get use to it.Im sure in the end it will be ok and do it's job. That is why 3 stars."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Love,Watch is great. This is an upgrade. First one stopped working after a year. Glad I bought it again.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,"Great for fitness, limited as a smartwatch","The Fitbit Versa 4 is a strong option for fitness tracking, offering built-in GPS, heart rate monitoring, and over 40 exercise modes. Its sleek design and long battery life (up to 6 days) make it convenient for everyday wear. The sleep tracking features and Alexa integration are useful additions. However, the lack of third-party app support and music storage limits its versatility as a full-featured smartwatch. If fitness is your priority, this is a solid choice, but it may fall short for those wanting more tech options."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Great for working out,"This fitbit is great for tracking my steps, sleep, exercise and food intake. I like that it tracks my micronutrients and calorie intake and output. The only two issues are the bands give my arm a rash. I wear it on one wrist during the day and the other at night. Be sure to wipe down after sweating under it to further prevent rash. The second issue is the oxygen saturation sensor is iffy only capturing once in a while. Recommend."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Make sure you have the latest version of the fitbit app,"When I first got this, it would not maintain sync.  I updated the firmware on the watch, tried doing a factory reset twice, uninstalled/reinstalled the fitbit app twice, ensured that the app wasn't allowed to go to sleep when in the background... nothing worked.  It would work for a few minutes, then when I tried to command Alexa, it would say connection lost.  I decided to contact support, and they informed me that my app was outdated.  Come to find out, version 4.04 of the bitbit app is too old, and will not work.  The latest version, 4.06.7 had not been released for my phone yet, as is typical ridiculous play store behavior.  Google... are you listening?  When a developer releases an update, you shall IMMEDIATELY make it available to EVERY device!  I manually downloaded the apk and installed it, and everything has been working great since.  Alexa follows my direct orders immediately, phone calls come through, texts come through, and I can sync with ease.Overall, I suppose this is an improvement over the Versa 2.  Screen is a little bigger, but the notification vibrations don't seem to be as forceful, even when set to strong.This uses google wallet instead of google pay as the Versa 2 did, so my AmEx will not work for contactless payment.Phone call feature is nice, seems to work OK.  I can hear them, they can hear me.  You can only answer calls, you can't make them.  The $50 brand x watch I ordered to replace this one before I got the sync figured out was able to do that.  It could also control my camera and music player, neither of which is possible on the Versa 4.Google maps is nice if you walk in unfamiliar areas.  I'll probably never need it, but it's nice.Battery life seems to be improved over the Versa 2, but mine was 2 years old so I'm sure the battery had gradually decreased it's charge capacity.  I used it for several days, and he battery was still at 55%.Skin temperature sensor will one day be nice when it can sync with a smart thermostat and automatically adjust the temperature as needed.  But for now, it's just a novelty and has no purpose.  Yes, I know my skin is hot.  I woke up in a puddle of sweat.  Yup, I'm freezing, so my skin is cold.o2 saturation is nice if you have any relevant health problems.If you want to take full advantage of the watch, get the free ""Overview"" clock face by Chris Blyth.  It gives you current and average heart rate, battery percentage, fully customizable date format, allows for a larger clock that shows seconds, and you can have weather, and 6 other health stats displayed on the main screen, all at once.  I have steps, distance, calories burned, active zone minutes, floors, and BMI/BMR.  It all fits, and is easy to read.  Vast improvement over the default face, which shows no useful information.  I had th is face on my versa 2, and loved it.  So glad it's available for the 4.Bottom line, it's a good watch.  There are cheaper brand x ones out there, but none of them have NFC payment, and not all of them have Alexa.  And, you get what you pay for.  fit & finish feels cheap, the screens get washed out in the sun, finicky alexa integration and so on.  Best to pony up and get a refined product.  Be sure to update your fitbit app.  Their customer support said the latest version should be released within a week, but I circumvented the beurocracy and downloaded it manually.  Why wait?"
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,1,Poor GPS performance,"Do not buy this watch to track runs.I’ve had a persistent problem with the Versa 4 where the first mile or so of GPS tracking is wildly inaccurate even on perfectly clear days.  It doesn’t always fail, but maybe 50% of the time or more, and appears to be getting worse lately.  The two screenshots are of the same loop run.  One shows a reasonable track, the other shows the issue I'm having with the watch, where the GPS tracking inaccurate and thus incorrectly reports distance and pace.I purchased this watch in December 2023 for my son who didn’t use it.  I started using it 6 or 7  months later when my Versa 3 died.I have 30+ years of experience debugging and resolving issues, a master’s degree in computer science and work as a director of engineering.  I’ve owned both Garmin and the prior Versa 3 GPS watches.I contacted fitbit support last November as I was fed up with the poor performance.  They were cheery and stated their commitment to resolving the issue.Support:  try loosening the watchband as far as possible.Me:  I don’t like a loose watch while running, but I’ll try it.  No luckSupport:  keep the watch away from your bonesMe:  The watch generally sits by the wrist bone, but since I’ve loosened it up, I’ll try sliding it up my forearm.  The problem persists.Support:  Factory reset the watch.Me:  I went through the tedious factory reset process and appeared to have success on the first following run.  But the problem reappeared on the next runSupport:  Your fitbit app is out of date, it’s 4.34.11 and needs to be 4.35Me:  I’m not having problems with the fitbit application, I’m having problems with the watch.  I went to update to 4.35 on my Android phone, but it wasn’t available.Support:  You need to wait for 4.35 to come out in order for us to continue this case.Me:  I waited for 4.35 to come out and resent the screen-shots of my failed runs.Support:  In the fitbit application go to exercises/run and make sure GPS is enabled.Me:  There are no exercise/run settings in the phone app, but there are on the Versa 4 watch.  I’ve sent them many screen-shots of the GPS tracked runs using the Versa 4.  Sent them a picture of GPS being enabled on the watch.Support:  Make sure the phone app has GPS always privileges and has privileges to run in the background.Me:  What does this have to do with the GPS on my watch?  Sent screenshots to show that GPS is always enabled on the phone app and it is permitted to run in the background.[I'm now waiting for another response, but they continue to throughout seemingly unrelated solutions to the fundamental issue]Note:  I’ve noticed now, with V4.35 of the fitbit application on my phone, that the Versa 4 will immediately report “GPS Connected” when I start a run, even if I’m in the house with both my phone and watch.  Neither can access the GPS satellites.  I suspect, with this version of the phone app, the watch is using the phone’s location services to indicate GPS connection, even if the phone is using Cell or WiFi to get approximate location.  The initial mile or so of my runs remains inaccurate, even though the watch starts off with “GPS connected”.Fitbit support does not seem to be focused on the source of my issue, the poor performance of the GPS system on this Versa 4 watch.  Is my watch faulty, or does the Versa 4 have a weak GPS system in it’s design?  I don’t know.This watch is not useful for tracking runs.  I would recommend anyone looking for a run-tracking watch look elsewhere.  The Versa 3 took a little time to get initial GPS lock, but then tracked without problems.  The Garmins locked quickly and were accurate."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Pretty much love,"I had a Samsung Active 2 watch that finally died on me. I thought that watch was pretty awesome, but hated that it had to be charged every other day, so I decided I was going to get something different.. and then I got this watch.. I get about 11 days with gps. Sooo nice!The Versa 4 has me pretty much in love.All of the things that this watch can do is just amazing. I got it to monitor health, track my steps, and routes.. it does so much more. It's missing a few things, but I can live without them.Talking on it was cool for a minute, kinda felt like inspector gadget, but I'd rather just use my phone.. lol.I really wish it was linked to my alarms on my phone.. I got used to being able to hit snooze from my watch. The alarm on my Versa is a very dull vibration that I surprisingly can feel.. and is good at waking me up, but it goes off everyday, even when it's not set to.I think the steps are off a little bit, but aren't they all?!I miss having YouTube Music linked, so I could control what my earbuds played.. but it's ok.*edit* I figured this out and can now utilize the app.All the perks that this watch offer really outweigh the 2 or 3 things it doesn't do.The band is super soft, and doesn't irritate my skin at all, which had me concerned, because I have sensitive skin, and seen that some people had issues.*edit* after several months of wear I did start getting a red, raised, itchy rash. I ended up switching out the band and the rash has since resolved.It was super easy to add the Fitbit app onto my Samsung phone and get everything set up.I decided to try the premium for the free 6 months, and I'm pretty sure I'll keep it.. I like all the extra stats that are available, and $79 a year isn't bad. I mean, I pay $13.99 a month for no commercials on YouTube, so.. there's that.*edit* I did decide to keep premium and am enjoying the benefits.When you get everything all set up through your Google account you're offered a 2 year warranty on your watch for $29.99 that covers all sorts of stuff.. enter in the serial number and it's done.Great color, stays synched, nice big screen that I can see even in the brightest light, and it does everything it's supposed to.*edit* I do have issues from time to time with my watch syncing to my phone and will need to restart my phone for it to happen. It could be that I have an older model phone, or it could be the watch, but it is a very easy fix. I had to contact support (super fast, very friendly) and they walked me through this process the 1st time.Overall, this watch was a good price, lots of perks, helps me stay motivated, and I really like everything it keeps track of for me."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Elegant and lots of features,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I still am exploring it but I liked it so far. I have had it for few days now..- You can receive phone calls on the watch and have the option to answer or hang up.- You can receive text messages and read them. You can even reply with an emoticon that will pop up on the watch.- You can receive email notifications on your watch, archive them, clear them or open them.- In order to receive calls/texts/e-mails, you need to plug your watch (charge it) and go on your Fitbit App to activate this feature, after clicking on your picture.You also need to ensure in your phone settings, that you have notifications ON for your phone and you will be able to receive all those notifications on your watch.- In order to enjoy the functionality of your watch to its maximum potential, you need to invest time to explore its different features.  I find the e-mails I receive from Fitbit very useful to teach how to use. That is how I learnt. Or else, I wouldn't be able to automatically receive the notifications.- GPS: I have not been able to use it yet, but plan on doing so soon. However, when you put Google Maps on your phone (Android), you should be able to receive the notifications (of turn right on X street, keep straight, turn left, etc...) on you watch. Which is cool.- Weather: you can have the weather at your fingertips! It showcases the weather in the area you are in automatically. If you tap on it, it will let you see a forecast of 2 hours at a time, as well as next 2 days! Isn't it cool!?- Heart Rate (when active and when at rest!) Cool feature!- Steps/Miles/Calories/Exercise like any Fitbit- Clock: If you go on the app online, you can actually add up to 5 clock backgrounds! For Free if you click from Fitbit. Otherwise, there are some tier parties that either do for Free, or Charge a minimal fee.It is easy and fast to change and download!- Timers: there are 2 preset timers (5 and 10 minutes), or you can click on the 3 dots and select/customize your timer! When time is up, it will vibrate on your hand and give you the option to end it or repeat it.- Double Click: it gives you options- Press long on the left button: and you can program it on your Fitbit App, to lock to the feature of your liking! I chose the ""Find my phone"" feature, which is pretty loud and works well!I am sharing a detailed review because I wish I found one similar to explain all the features.If you like my review and find it useful, please click on the thumbs up. Thank you!"
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,"Few Improvements, More Restrictions","The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            *I'm a Fitbit Versa 2 owner, going to Fitbit Versa 4 I have been using this new watch since late Decemeber*BATTERY:Seemed fine to me. I'm not a person that doesn't ever charge my watch though. I always charge it when I shower. The charger is WAY better than Versa 2's charging cradle. No more fiddling around with it, dreading the ""not enough power"" error. This sits right on top of the charger.APPS:-- There is no music support-- they have the ""find my phone"" app. Works like it should.-- THERE IS NO CALCULATOR APP! WHY!?!-- no 3rd party supported apps. Whatever you have already installed is what you get. You can't get ANY other apps other than preinstalled. No notes app, no calculator, no memos, NOTHING. Hugely disappointing!!! Why would they do this?GOOGLE:--Google wallet is great and very easy to set up. You don't have to have the google wallet app on your phone to set it up; it's all through fitbit.NAVIGATION:Navigation works....but I don't think I would use it when you're driving. It's just not as easy to glance at or give as much detail as your phone will. You can have both your watch and phone navigating at the same time. I thought it might vibrate when to indicate an upcoming turn or something but it doesn't.DISPLAY:Crisp, clear display. Touch screen is very reactive, as is the button on the side. The watch is supposed to come on when you lift your arm, but this is very fidley and I find it only works half the time.CALLS:Calls are fantastic. You can hear clearly and be heard just as well. You can't make calls, only accept them.CLOCKS:-- I was disappointed to find that my Fitbit Versa 2 clocks would not be compatible with Versa 4. Honestly, I'm not sure why Fitibit doesn't have a fully customizable clock face, with custom settings and custom pictures. No, they leave that for other developers to figure out. I loved using Maxim clock faces, as everything could be customized (stats,colors,time, placements, and photo). No such luck here. There are a lot of options, and I did find one suitable for me. Should be offered by Fitbit themselves though. They have to know that most people want a personal picture on their device. If you are just looking for a cool background, there are tons to choose from.I found a photo clock that worked for me named Photo 2 by Wim Van Aerschot. There's a free version and a Premium versionPROS:-- Slim, lightweight-- No trouble syncing-- Google wallet is 1000x better than fitbit pay, which only supports certain banks. None of my cards (sam's club visa, capital one credit/debit) worked with fitbit pay. They work perfectly with google-- While you now have ""tiles"" that show your apps one by one as you swipe left or right (On versa 2 you swiped down and selected from a list) isn't as user friendly, you CAN rearange the tiles how you please. And you can add shortcuts via long press of the button, if you want. You can also choose to hide tiles you don't want.-- Calories burned seems very accurate. They reflect my suggested metabolic rateCONS:-- The style of the band is odd. The material is great, but for some reason they thought it would be wise to tuck the extra bit UNDER the band, not on top. It isn't irritating like I thought it would, but it makes it a big pain to take off and put back on. The extra bit also means you might have to readjust size because the extra bit is tighter on your wrist. It leaves marks on your arm. Even most off brand bands still feature the ""under loop"" fastener, but you can buy silicone ""band keepers"" that slip right over the band, allowing you to fasten as normal.-- Lost Calories. For some reason, I have LOST calories, particularly after syncing or charging. I've lost 200-300 cal this way. Very irritating and it can make a huge difference if you are in a calorie deficit. I haven't had it happened since, but worth noting.--It doesn't show calories eaten on any of the tiles. Furthermore, the ""calories left"" on the ""today's tile"" does NOT reflect calories eaten. Previously in the Versa 2, the Fitbit app would show how many calories you have left in that moment of time, whereas the watch would show how much you had left based on predicted calorie burn for the day. This watch only shows calories left to burn, based on your chosen ""calories burned"" goal.-- Stats don't stack as they used to on Versa 2. You can rearrange them for sure, and that helps, but you otherwise have to keep swiping to see each stat separately. It seemed cleaner when they stacked on top of each other and you have to scroll down. Scrolling down from the clock face only shows settings, no quick select for google wallet (although you can set up shortcuts for long press on the button)You can get around this somewhat; for instance, I put the ""today's tile"" on top of the list and the weather tile on the bottom. A swipe to the right brings up today's tile quickly. A swipe to the left brings up the weather. Otherwise, you have to keep swiping to get different stats.-- while there is never trouble syncing, if you step away from your phone for too far or too long, you will have to resync. This was a problem with Versa before. I work in a fairly small, single story building and very few times can I actually respond to text messages without getting the error to resync. Fitbit desperately needs to increase the range of the bluetooth.-- you can't ""write"" messages, like you can with Apple watches. You can respond either with voice (which does work well to be fair) or choose from a few quick responces from a list.FINAL THOUGHTS: I do love this watch, but keep in mind there are few improvements with many missing features. For a casual wearer, I think the update is well worth it. Downsides in customization, stats, and absent apps should be considered, however, and given that this watch has been out for a long while, it is unlikely to change. I'd say if your happy with your old Fitbit model, just keep it and skip on this."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,3,Overall good excecpt the heart rate tracker - which is important,"If someone asked me whether I like this watch or not, I would say that I like it. It is simple and the interface is decent. I do not want a watch that attempts to replace my phone, but rather one that complements it. I think that the Fitbit Versa is a good choice for this. It tells me notifications, tracks sensor telemetry, tracks my physical state, and has decent battery life. These are things that my phone cannot easily do.Other smart watches such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch do too much. I don't really care that I can reply to texts, browse the web, or essentially replace my phone. I always have my phone on or near me. If I am too busy to reply on my phone then I also wouldn't reply on my watch, an only worse experience because they try to cram a full QWERTY keyboard on it.I bought the Fitbit Versa 4 because one of my requirements is that the watch I use has Google Pay on it. It does not at release, but I'm fine with it coming later as it is not an immediate requirement. I also assumed that the fitness tracking on Fitbit would be good because Fitbit is basically the oldest consumer tracker company I know of, so I guessed it probably works well.Comfort - 9/10The strap that it came with is quite comfortable. I do not wear watches, primarily because the ones I have tried were not very comfortable.  This watch and strap is pretty good. I've only had one day tuning the tightness and position where it was uncomfortable and that was my fault as it was too tight. I also like that it is small and light. I mostly forget it is there, and am comfortable sleeping it with.Update Nov. 5th 2022: After about a month of wearing it almost 24/7 I have some irritation. Also if I sleep with it and put weight upon the watch band (the watch face going down in to the bed) I will wake up with a lot of irritation.Interface  - 7/10The interface is mostly intuitive. It is not that clunky as some smart watches I have seen in the past. The main thing I do not like and I didn't quite get at first was that the apps list is found by pressing the button. I didn't know how to use the alarm the first night because of this. But overall it works. It is mostly responsive, but sometimes not if it is rendering many things in the interface. I can forgive this as it is not a super powerful watch. I am happy with this.Battery life- 8/10One of the primary things that I want in a smart watch is a longish battery life. The more general smart watches' battery life is not that great. This one lasts about 3 days with the always on display turned on, which I am happy with. I will try it with the always on display off to see how it lasts. With sleep mode on it drains about 10% battery over 8 hours.Update Nov. 5th 2022: With display not on always-on, then it lasts about 7-9 days depending on how much I exercise.Sleep Tracking - 10/10I am quite impressed with the sleep tracking. I don't have to tell it anything. It just knows that I am sleeping and tracks it. Even random naps that I take in the evening. I do not know the times I fall asleep, but it is always on the exact minute I wake up. Good job on this, and I quite like it. As for the oxygen saturation tracking, I have nothing to compare it against so who knows, it could be made up for all I know.Heart rate - 3/10Oof, this is not good and I am quite disappointed with. During the day at work and home it seems to be fine. This is good for capturing my resting heart rate which I am interested in. But during workouts it is basically useless. I have worked out 3 times with it since I got it, and it is just wildly inaccurate. The only thing it is good for is using the workout timer to count my pulse manually. While doing some spinning in the gym I consistently measure my pulse at 170-180 BPM, but this thing is measuring as low as 90 BPM to 160 BPM, usually ranging in 130-150. I can forgive being off by 10 or so BPM, but this is just wild. Once my heart rate goes about 140 or 150 it just becomes useless. It will vary by 10 BPM each measurement, vibrate warning my heart rate is not in ""the zone."" Well that sucks. I bought this thing specifically so that I could track my workout, hoping because Fitbit is a well known brand that it would do this specific thing well, and it does not.Other -I like the alarm, but I think all watches do something like that. I use the weather occasionally, and the timer is fine. I would prefer that it sets the timer, and allows me to actually start it rather than automatically starting when I lock-in a time, but that a minor gripe. The phone interface is good, and I think that it summarizes the telemetry pretty well. I also like the default watchface, and have not changed it.Update Nov. 5th 2022: I did not realize this before, but the alarm only alarms for like 20 or 30 seconds before turning off. This is fine some times, but other times I need way more effort to wake up. I have no seen a way to configure this. I would prefer that it alarms until I turn it off.ConclusionIf I can find a smart watch that is similar size, as I do like that this one is small and light, I may replace it. Mainly because of the heart rate tracking. But I am very impressed with the sleep tracking, and i like the battery life and comfort so I am going to stick with it for now. I hope that heart rate tracking can be fixed with a software update, because I do want to like this watch."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Poor replica of Versa 2,"After 2.5 years my Fitbit Versa 2 stopped working: the side button would not respond and the touch screen would not respond. I purchased a Fitbit Versa 4 because the device worked well until problems started a week before it didn't work at all. With that background info, I have used my Versa 4 less than 24 hours. So far the watch is OK, not great. My Versa 2 is the first type of this device technology so I only have this comparison to go by. There seems to be no flexibility with the apps that are pre-installed. There are no apps to add a very limited selection for a clock face. I haven't encountered anything that ""wows"" me. I'll update my review if things change. Typically things change for the better but not to this device! So sad."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Love it,First one i ordered was a total dud. Kept turning on and off on its own and it was missing two of the three watch bands which didn't bother me because I got a different band for it that would be more comfortable for me than the standard silicon band. Amazon let me send that one back and they replaced it with a brand new one. The new one works perfectly. I've had no issues. I love it.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Quick startup but step counter way off,"Update to the update--------------------------I found where I could get rid of the stupid weather, and also function rearranging.I'm happy. Back to 4 stars.What a Rollercoaster.Update - about 20+ uses in.-------------------------------Watch keeps pausing my exercises. And I dont usually figure it out til I'm done, which by then it's too late.  The chance to count the calories burned has already past.The ""smart features"" it has are very problematic.  It'll randomly want to start recording an excercise, and will also - as mentioned - pause my exercises mid way through.It tries to do too much on it's own...and it wouldnt be that bad if it wasnt wrong so often.I just want a watch that can track my heart rate, count calories, and track time & distance.I want it to start only when I tell it to, and stop only when I tell it to.The hardware might also need to be rethought.  The on/off button seems to engage when I'm curling my wrist backwards.Last complaint, and a worthy one..The app doesn't seem to give you any control over the functions on the watch.Example, to get to the exercise function on the watch...I have to scroll past the weather.Nobody wants to see the fuXing weather.  Get rid of it....or give me the chance to remove it from the navigation.This isn't advanced tech, this is old tech. And that's okay if you they would have just kept it simple.If anyone in that company is reading this...just remember that applying common sense will go a long ways.Don't get this watch. It's annoying.End of update------------------Second day of having this watch.  A+ for simplicity, speed, and common sense layout.  F- for the step counter.I was laying on my couch drinking coffee and it tracked that I had taken 480 steps and walked up one flight of stairs. I was only half way through my first cup. Umm..huh?We'll see how it goes. Feeling cautiously optimistic.  Might just have to ignore the step counter when I'm not exercising."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,My Fitbit,It was working fine and I was going to charge it this morning. It will not come on. What am I supposed to do. I can't get it to come on.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Updated: Google/Fitbit provided excellent warranty support to resolve issues,"Google/Fitbit customer service provided excellent warranty support to replace defective watch within a week.  Now it is working fine with the replacement provided.  Watch build quality seems good on the outside but concerned about touchscreen electronics failing due to some design issues....PREVIOUS:Worked okay at start, but now touch sensitivity is erratic to the point of making the watch useless - a watch should last more than a year.  Others reporting the same issue on forums."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Love the updated features,"I ordered this watch because my Fitbit Versa was about 10 years old and wasn't working as well.  I absolutely do not like the watch band!  I have a small wrist and the band is bulky, rubbery and uncomfortable.  I've ordered a different band and hopefully it will be a better product. Just wish I could find a more delicate style."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Love it,"I love my Fitbit. It stays charged for days on end, tracks my sleep, my exercise, my steps so well. My only complaint is the strap it comes with rubs on the arm and leaves a mark other then that nothing bad to say!"
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Fast deliver and product is good,I am wearing it every day. Loving the displays you can choose for it and loving how many things it can keep track of for you.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Nice watch but small font,This is a nice watch but the font is not adjustable so it’s very difficult to read. There is no way I can turn on notifications and read them. I will likely return it.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,"Good watch, good price.","FITBIT watches are very good. This is my 3rd one. I usually have had no trouble setting them up.  I had to Google several features this time and still can't get one to work. Printed instructions would be help. Still, I am pleased with my new watch and hope to enjoy it for many years."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,I love fitbit,"The battery last daysss! That's my favorite part. The band was a little bit uncomfortable, but this new one fabric flexible feels better for my small wrist."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,"Great for biking, but still can't read heartrate on tattooed skin.","I have owned a Fitbit Alta, Charge 4, and now this Versa 4.My biggest complaint is that the Versa 4 cannot read my heartrate on my arm that is tattooed. If I want the heartrate monitor to work, I cannot wear my fitbit on the wrist I typically wear a watch on, and that is deeply frustrating. I had the same issue with the Charge 4 and was really hoping this time would be different. (The Alta never had this issue, so I was hoping it was specific to the Charge 4 sensor. Alas!) If you have a tattoo sleeve, beware! And if you know of a fitness watch that works great on tattooed skin, I'd love to hear it.However, the Versa 4 has worked much better for tracking my heartrate (on my non-tattooed arm) when I am out on my bike. The Charge 4 heartrate monitor would often stop working while I was actively biking (maybe because of the jostling? How my wrist was positioned?), only working again when I was stopped at a stoplight or at the end of a ride. The Versa 4 monitor does not have this issue! It has been very reliable at tracking my heartrate while I am out on the trail, and I am much happier!I was hesitant to buy the Versa 4 because it is so much larger and bulkier than the other Fitbit models I have used in the past, but I do enjoy the ""Today's Activity"" display that puts so many stats on one screen. There are also a lot of options for clock faces / displays, which I appreciate. It doesn't feel as bulky to wear as I thought it would. The access to more information and displays has made it worth the larger size.My only other complaint is that I wish I could find a better option for more prominently displaying my heartrate zone while I am working out. This is the major reason I have a fitness tracker! I wanted a clock face or a tile that made this information easy to access. I figured out if I tell my fitbit to track my workout, that I can then swipe over to a screen with my heartrate zone visible. On my Charge 4, my clock face displayed this information all the time, and I loved it. I don't love having to click through several menus to get this info on the Versa 4."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Review,It would be great if you could call or text.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,good good,"good fit, timely delivery, easy set up, does not hold charge long as the versa 2 did"
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,"Works great, with one exception","Ordered this device as an upgrade to my Fitbit Charge 2, which I’d had for well over 10 years.The functionality is great and there are so many new features. If you don’t look close, you would think you have on an iWatch.My issue was with the band which is made of silicone. Bands for the older device were plastic but contained no silicone. I encountered an allergic reaction/chemical burn (see photo) after wearing it for about 4 days. Had to leave it off for about a week until the area healed. While waiting I ordered cloth bands which work perfectly for me."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Working so far! Dexcom g6 compatible. Here's how I connected it...,"I bought this because I loose my dexcom receiver once in awhile.  Attached to my wrist, I won't loose it!  I was leery that it works.  I had to switch phones, my Motorola was not supported by dexcom software, see dexcom website for compatibility.1. Make sure you phone will receive dexcom.  The phone reads it, and just sends data to the watch.  Phone has to be within about 20 feet of you.  A. When phone is out of your area..you will loose Bluetooth connection.  B.  If that happens, all I have had to do is open the fit it app on my phone and it starts syncing again .2. Download fitbit app to your phone.  Fitbit is owned by google, now.  You will need a gmail account.  They are free.-- the fitbit app is very clear, follow the menus and change your phone settings to ensure it works well!  The watch will auto connect if everything is set correctly.3. Download the Dexcom app onto your phone.  This software is very good, as well.  It walks you thru any setting s that need adjustment. You do not need Clarity, just the main Dexcom app!--you are successful when your phone starts reading you cgm!  Ps. You need your sensor and transmitter numbers! My transmitter # had to come from my Dexcom receiver!  The sensor...dug in the trash! Found it!4. Last step.  Go to your fitbit app on your phone.  There is a blue icon to select screens, see YouTube videos for visuals!  Search for ""Glance"".  It was created for this use.  download it for your fit it watch.Now you are ready to wear your watch!!! Done!Ps. There are some good YouTube videos that discuss Versa 4 connecting to a dexcom g6 and g7.Hey, fitbit...get on the ball and create 1 software to download and give a set of screen gui's!  Make it easy for people!!Its been a couple weeks.  I had to adjust my alert settings.  It was buzzing me all night.  It DID wake me up to say I was going low.  Does a good job with heart rate and sleep patterns is interesting.What does NOT work? The step counter.  My first 8 hours, I was asleep.  It was going nuts with alert vibrations.  The FitBit was VERY proud I had walked 150,000 steps at night, asleep.  I must get tons of work out.  No wonder I don't sleep well! 😁😁😁😁😂😂 it counted each vibration on all the alerts all night as steps!!! Stupid watch.  I have not tried to fix it.  Don't care about that function.I really like the convenience for CGM. I still need my regular receiver.  But this is a quicker glance and a quieter alert.  Its also nice to have weather, and maybe Alexa and Google maps.  Have not tried the maps yet.  Google voice is not loud enough unless its held on your ear!"
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,My New Versa Watch,"So far, I'm vary pleased with this watch. It looks nice, fits comfortably and does a fine job in tracking my steps, calories burned, heart rate and sleep stages. Also, I'm pleased with how the alerts come to me on this watch. The way it notifies you of a text or incoming call is subtle but not enough not to get your attention. I have had another smart watch from a well known brand before, actually two from the same company. They were really good smart watches too but they almost had too much going on with them, so much capacity to do this and that functionality. It was like wearing a small computer on my wrist. Now, that I'm sure is great for a lot of people but I was looking for something not quite so busy in all it can do. This Versa 4 has done that for me and has done it well! I a m very pleased with this purchase and would of course recommend."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Super easy transition from Versa Lite to Versa 4,Fit is perfect; replaced  5 yr old Versa Lite; I am very happy. Color wasn't my first choice but I can replace band later. This is my 5th Fitbit product and I love the brand.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Great fitness tracker!,"Let me state at the outset, I do not like wearing jewerly and especially to sleep in. That is where my displeasure with this device began. It is great if you don't mind having something on your wrist and can be a real assest to monitoring your progress. As of my last update in January 2022, Fitbit had not released a Versa 4 model. However, I can provide you with a general review of what a Fitbit Versa 4 might offer based on the features you've mentioned.The Fitbit Versa series is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking capabilities and smartwatch functionalities. Here's what you might expect from a Fitbit Versa 4:Fitness Tracking: Like its predecessors, the Fitbit Versa 4 would likely offer advanced fitness tracking features to help users monitor their activity levels, track workouts, and set fitness goals. This could include 24/7 heart rate monitoring, step tracking, distance traveled, calories burned, and more.Daily Readiness: The inclusion of daily readiness features would enable users to gauge their readiness for physical activity based on factors such as heart rate variability, sleep quality, and overall recovery. This can help users optimize their training routines and prevent overtraining.GPS: Built-in GPS would allow users to accurately track outdoor activities such as running, cycling, and hiking without the need to carry a smartphone. This feature enables users to map their routes, monitor pace and distance, and analyze performance metrics more effectively.Exercise Modes: With over 40 exercise modes, users would have access to a wide range of activity profiles tailored to different workouts and sports. Whether you're into running, swimming, yoga, or weightlifting, the Fitbit Versa 4 would likely offer dedicated tracking modes to suit your needs.Smartwatch Features: In addition to its fitness tracking capabilities, the Fitbit Versa 4 would function as a full-featured smartwatch, offering features such as notifications for calls, texts, and app alerts, music playback controls, contactless payments, customizable watch faces, and more.Battery Life: Fitbit Versa models typically offer multi-day battery life on a single charge, allowing users to wear their smartwatch continuously without frequent recharging. The Versa 4 would likely maintain this tradition, providing long-lasting battery performance to support all-day activity tracking and smartwatch usage.Overall, a Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch with Daily Readiness, GPS, 24/7 Heart Rate, and 40+ Exercise Modes would be a versatile and feature-rich wearable device designed to help users lead healthier, more active lifestyles. It would combine advanced fitness tracking capabilities with convenient smartwatch functionalities to provide a comprehensive health and wellness solution."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,3,"Interesting, entertaining, but not inconsistent.","Lightweight. Rapid charge. Nice display.I can't rate connectivity, since the wifi at my house is lousy.I am diabetic and like the way I can enter BS readings.I believe I set it to display when I shake my arm - it doesn't.I can be going through the screens - and it goes dark.The Fitbit/watch will say ""no data available"" -- but I find/see the data is on my phone!It only seems to ""lose"" 25-30% of my steps, because I am usually carrying something so my arm does not swing.Even worse - I climbed 1.5 floors of steps -- and it only count one step!!!I can walk 3K steps and then sit down to watch a movie - and it tells me to walk.I can walk for hours -- and it tells me to take it easy!I use it as a watch rather than directing my activity.For the cost it's provided some entertainment and definitely a handy watch.However, I don't believe I would purchase again."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,New fitbit,Love the new fitbit.The new charging cor is a lott better and easier to use. The apps are  a little nicer.I've had a problem with the face of the fitbit in the past.  After 1to 2 years the face of the fitbit would pop off and that's why it got 4⭐.I hope they've fix this problem.🤔I'll Let you know in a year
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Gives me an adjective on a daily basis!,Not Teck Savy but can understand what I need too.Helped me to understand my sleep rating that is actually good!
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Great product!,"Great size, has long battery life, easy to connect to phone, easy to use app, charges fast, easy to monitor heart rate!"
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Everything I hoped (expected),"So I got the Versa 4 when it was on sale this holiday season and am very happy with it. It does all the things my Charge 2 did (it was from 2017 but worked perfectly) and more. I really just wanted a bigger watch face so decided to finally upgrade. It was fairly easy to set up - just followed a couple of videos on Youtube for that and to get a better idea how to work everything. Only had it for about a week but in that short time, I've really enjoyed it. I love the bigger screen, I like having access to Alexa on my wrist, I like being able to check the weather, I like being able to choose which apps I want notifications from, I like that it has built-in GPS. And of course, it does all the usual fitness tracking. I don't really care about the heart rate tracker (also not sure how accurate) but it does have it. I don't love the strap that comes with it - so I'll probably change that in the near future. Overall, I would really recommend this to anyone looking for the things I mentioned."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Not same as Versa 3 Texts not shown easily,"Be aware Google is getting rid of everything Fitbit and wants to sell their own branded fitness devices instead. They took some features with them. My husband especially liked previous Versa 3 feature of seeing texts on the watch screen automatically, especially when driving and exercising and navigating Spotify from watch. App functionality has been taken away. He also says battery life is shorter on 4 than 3.  RIP Fitbit, thanks for the many years of making this technology usable by the masses.Edit - He searched around online and changed some settings and now he can see text messages immediately if he turns his wrist."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Love the look,I would love to give this a 5 but not every thing works on this tracker. It’s beautiful and is comfortable. It does track my steps and exercises. But will never connect to phone calls and sometimes not my messages. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Also did a factory reset. That worked for ab a half hour. Not sure if I got a dud.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Great Product!,Great product! Fast and easy set up with great battery life!
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Wife loves it like I love mine,"I've had one of these for a couple of years, and my wife wanted one for Christmas.  She tried one of the cheap android fitness watches and didn't like it.  She loves this one for tracking steps and exercise activity.  The only thing that is different is mine originally came with a year of free premium services like oxygen levels, but hers didn't.  Mine did cost more though and hers was on sale, that might be the difference."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Fitbit Versa 4,Okay
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Great guft,The face of the watch is a bit big and I'm still trying to get use to the rest of the stuff. I like it so far
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Trying another one,"Loved, loved loved my Fitbit Versa2 that I had for just shy of 4 yrs then I didn't - Vers2 stopped tracking sleep, heartrate and no reminders to move. It became a watch and pedometer! I DID NOT want to go GOOGLE brand, hate that they bought out Fitbit.  Caught a decent price for the Versa4 even though Fitbit support sites indicated it also has issues and not being supported by GOOGLE.Versa4 screen is  not as user friendly as the Versa2 but I will have to learn to adapt."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Nice upgrade from older fitbit,My older fitbit was getting a little outdated and the battery wasn't holding a charge anymore.  I bought this one because it had additional features like the O2 sensor.  I am satisfied with the functions but the battery doesn't last as long as my old one did when it was new.  I am having to charge it about every 4 days.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Sleek and light on the wrist,I really like the new watch band. The navigation has been tightened up and the transition from one option to the next is very fluid.I’ll be testing it out after the 1st and see how well it holds up while running. So far it’s great…I highly recommend this model in particular (Versa 4) because it’s the latest model from what I’ve owned previously. This model has everything one could wish for in a fitness tracker.I look forward to when they come out with a waterproof model.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,works as intended,Works as intended
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,I don't know how I feel about this watch!,"I bought it for multiple reasons. One if the bigger reasons was to work with my Google Assistant. What I've learned since buying and using this watch surprised me. Google owns Fitbit, but Fitbit Versa 4 is not compatible with Google Assistant. I am not impressed with (No Offense Amazon) Alexa who is the only Voice Assistant on the watch. I don't have any devices that use Alexa other than my Fitbit and does not fit well in my setup. If I knew know before I ordered it, I would have picked a different Smartwatch. With that being said, be new to Smartwatchs, this one still isn't half bad."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Replacing Blaze,"My Fitbit Blaze I'd had since 2016 (or 2017?) was no longer holding a charge for me, and was becoming increasingly difficult to get to sync. I saw this one for a great price and decided to give it a shot. It's turning out to be a great choice. If I was an apple user I might've tried an apple watch, but I like my android phone. This Vera Fitbit is doing everything I need it to do, plus some, for less money and no extra charge on the phone bill."
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Love it,Love the watch its light  charges quickly love the rose gold color  feel like it tracks better then my old watch. Only thing I feel like the touch screen is super sensitive at times when scrolling. Im not a huge fan of the band it.comes with.  But 5 star
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,It’s reliable,It’s been my obsession since 2014
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,4,Don't Buy a Cheap Brand (Like Spade & Co) - Buy a Fit Bit or other recognized brand -,I have had two Fit Bits and each lasted almost four years.  I succumbed to the ads and background of Spade & Co and it failed in about 3 months.  Just ordered another Fit Bit Versa 4.  My stupid mistake - don't make the same one.  Fit Bit is very reliable.  I have had two in the last 8-9 years.
B0B4MWCFV4,Fitbit Versa 4 Fitness Smartwatch,5,Fitbit Watch Versa 4,A great watch for the more technological savvy.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,Like New!,"TL;DR. I got the iPhone 14 Pro gold 256 gb and it’s working decently! Sorted through the seller list and I think I picked a great one to buy from. Happy with this purchase.Seller Selection:Need to switch to a new phone since my old one has already stopped updating iOS. I was afraid of getting scammed based on some of the reviews, so I sorted through the sellers list and looked through all of their ratings. I went for a slightly more expensive buy from a seller with a better review overall (actually read the reviews and don’t believe the %positive stuff from Amazon, Amazon marks some of the reviews as “Amazon’s fault” and thus do not count them into the overall seller rating, however sometimes the reviews they crossed out are really, the seller’s product problem, which makes the review system kinda sketchy and suspicious.)I got mine from the seller “The Cell Whiz 2” (it has just an average % positive review rate, but I notice that most of the problems associated with it are minor and the seller looks very responsive to the reviews, so I picked it) and, I’m happy with it so far. In fact, I’m writing my review on this phone right now!The phone:It came in a cardboard box with a charger, both wrapped in a little plastic bag. The packaging doesn’t have any foam or other kinds of protection, so I was a bit worried upon receiving it. Fortunately, nothing cracked or seemed broken.The phone itself is so spotless I was afraid of getting my grimy fingers on it! I inspected all over the phone and only found a tiny chipped paint scratch on the frame of one of the camera lens. Honestly, no one would even find out about it. And you can’t even see it after you put a lens protection glass on.Setting up the phone was no issue, I transferred from my physical SIM to an eSIM successfully (though I was a bit nervous during the wait and when I had to click on install cellular again). Apple transferred all my data from my previous iPhone to this one very smoothly. It’s exactly like my old phone, except on a newer model.The battery capacity it came with is 89%. It’s not THE BEST, but it’s really good. I can still use it for a while before I need to change it.Overall, I’m happy with this purchase and hopefully everyone who’s reading this review can get a phone they like <3"
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,Excellent Quality so far.,My boyfriend got me this just because and it’s amazing the phone looked amazing almost brand new and battery life was at 90%. Everything works beautifully from the phone speed and response to the camera quality. It just super amazing. It’s indeed more than what I expected. I have only had it for two days but will check in should anything change. Thank
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Decent but not perfect.,Decent renewed phone. It was supposed to be excellent condition but did have a slight small scratch on corner and battery was exactly at 80%. Didnt feel like returning and dealing with finding another. Shipped and sold by Amazon but came in a non amazon packaging so not sure if it was amazon renewed or not compared to others i have purchased from amazon that come in their boxes.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,Better than expected!,"With refurbished I thought it would come with an aftermarket screen and perhaps an aftermarket battery and maybe have minor scuffs.  My phone arrived in a generic white box with aftermarket charger but the phone itself was in MINT condition.  I could not find a single scratch or scuff.  It was perfect physically.  Battery health was at 88%, that was the only indication that I could tell it had been used.  You can check if it had repairs done to it by going into Settings > General > About and if there is an option that shows “parts & services” then you know it was worked on and you can further see if the parts serviced are genuine when you click on it.  When I checked that option was not showing so that means it didn’t have any replacements or services done to it. That should not be the expectation when buying refurbished so I consider myself quite lucky and I am very happy with this purchase."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,Very satisfied,"Phone came in a timely manner and came as described. The phone was good overall. Some small marks on the screen that are barely noticeable with a screen protector. I wish the battery was a little better. It’s at 87% and he guarantees at least 85%. I would’ve been completely happy if the battery was around 92 or 93%, but you get what you get."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),3,I got what I paid for and it’s not terrible,I bought the acceptable one and the phone came with little to no scratches or dents a few scruffs on the edges and a prominent scratch on the middle top of the screen but it’s an upgrade from my XR so I don’t mind. The physical quality is good but the internal is where I’m like “yeah this is definitely ‘acceptable’ ” because the battery life was at 84% when I got it but I don’t mind since it’s a 1TB phone I will get the battery replaced. I also noticed the phone overheating a bit while transferring my data from my old phone i have felt it get warm a bit when downloading apps a bit concerning. But other than that it’s okay.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,For refurbished this iPhone 14 Pro looks and acts perfectly new.,"I like the fact that this phone has a feature to where you don’t have to go to your phone service provider to swap over all your data from your old phone to the phone I purchased, there was also no need to put a SIM card into this phone because it has a digital SIM card, so not only was transferring my data a breeze so was having my same number transferred as well, the phone looks like and works like new, for the money this was a great buy. It’s durable the screen is clear and has not one make on it, do yourself and don’t buy new again at some ungodly price, this was the Best Buy yet."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Nice phone…,"Received phone as described (minor scuff on casing lens), cable included was NOT the cable for the phone, so had no way of charging phone until I ordered cable with plug from another seller (this was disappointing considering how much I spent on the phone)… Didn’t bother getting in touch with seller, guess I should have so they could issued a correct charging cable and plug."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,battery health on excellent refurbished condition.,"I bought the “excellent” condition and it’s pretty brand new from what I can tell, however there is some dirt in the crevices of the phone including the silent switch and speaker holes. the battery life is also a little disappointing at 84%. however I’m sure it varies. But I did get what I paid for, Iphone, charger and charger box. the packaging did have me skeptical at first but that’s about it. pretty good phone just wish the battery health wasn’t worn out."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Great phone less than great battery health,The phone is great physically. No scratches or blemishes whatsoever. Everything was operating as expected. However the battery health came on 83% which isn’t ideal but it lasts me 14 hrs on a single charge which still isn’t that bad so let’s call it a winnish win
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Almost perfect!,"I chose the excellent refurbished 256gb space black model. So far I’m loving this phone, I was originally planning on upgrading to the 16 pro, but for what I do and functionality wise, I saved myself around $400ish buying this instead. Everything is perfect other than the battery, from what I see it’s sorta a gamble on the battery health however for being at 93%, this phone doesn’t die quick at all. If you have an older phone like a iPhone 12, this is definitely a big upgrade and worth the money. 9/10"
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Device looks/works flawlessly,"Purchased device in excellent condition and it’s actually 10/10 with no visible scratches or dings, it even came with a free screen protector installed. The only downside is that the device took a long time before it was shipped."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,"Good phone, but not what I expected","I changed my iPhone 11 for this 14 Pro because of storage and some cameras; besides the fact I always wanted a Pro phone. I really got amazed by the price, since in my country it was $200 more than here. Regarding the sending, the product arrived on time. I don’t live in the US, and when it arrived to Ecuador, I could finally check it. Color and storage capacity were as requested. Cameras work perfectly, same as the buttons, speakers and microphone. Dynamic Island works fantastic, and I’m even surprised for the AppleCare warranty. What I got disappointed about was the battery level, as I requested for a “Reconditioned-excellent” phone. Besides, the selling ad did not mention I was buying an ESIM version, so I had to change my chip. Ah, and let’s not forget the little dent you can see on the side. I confess I was very doubtful about buying here due to the comments: some positive and some really bad. My suggestion, buy at your own risk, but not ensuring to have a great phone or not."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,Honestly super good quality,I was very skeptical to order a refurbished phone on Amazon because I have never ordered outside of my mobile provider before and I saw NIGHTMARE reviews on Walmart’s website for refurbished phones of folks saying they ordered a phone just to find out it had been stolen. But I said okay Amazon is really good with returns god forbid it ends up being messed up or stolen. Nope! Super good quality phone and I got it 12 hours earlier than amazon said I would. Def a great option if you don’t need the absolute newest unused phone but need to upgrade. Got 1 TB IPhone 14 Pro in excellent condition and battery came at 85% capacity and it was unscathed and undamaged. Recommend.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,iPhone 14 pro,I was really satisfied with the phone I bought. I originally bought a different phone from Walmart and it came locked when they said it was “unlocked.” I bought this one from here and it came unlocked which made me really happy. I’d rate this a 5 star but it came with some scratches but it’s alright.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Had a software bug,"After I transferred data from an older IPhone, the 14 Pro developed a problem. The opening menu Lwelcome  etc started cycling rapidly and it would not proceed when I swiped upwards. I had to carry phone to Genius Bar at anApple store for them to wipe the data and restore the original starting menu. The phone battery was at 89% and it passed all of the diagnostic tests. The phone did not have anyThe phone worked as normal.  However I am nervous that this problem may reoccur.Otherwise it was a great buy"
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,"Incredible conditions phone, wrong charging cable.","I bought the iPhone 14 Pro and it came in incredible conditions, just how i expected to be because i selected on excellent conditions. Eveything of the phone its perfect. But the cable that gave it to me with this phone was USB-C to USB-C and this phone use Lightning cable so i was little upset for this."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Good Option for Refurbished,Everything looks great! No scratches that I can see. Only downside is the phone came with 84% Battery Health. Wish it was closer to 90%.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Looks New But 85% Battery,Phone Looks And Feels Brand New. Battery Health Is At 85% Only Flaw
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Charging port was dirty/plugged,"I have bought Amazon Renewed phones 5-6 times now and this was the only one I had a problem with. Works great other than the charging port was dirty and plugged and wouldn't hold a charge. You get what you get when you buy Renewed, but this port probably should have been inspected/caught.We were able to carefully clean it out and it’s fine now, just lucked out on this one."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,iPhone 14pro,Great quality. Excellent battery life. 10/10 recommend.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Not that bad,Excellent and came in good condition.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Product came great!,"It's my first time purchasing something from Amazon renewed, iPhone came great overall, no visible damages or scratches, battery came at 86% of health, unlocked. The only thing it's that it came in an ugly box, but didn't affect functionality at all, great product"
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,Very satisfied with the purchase!,The iPhone arrived a day earlier than expected and the iPhone was in mint condition. Setting up the new iPhone was a breeze and copying the data/apps from the old to new phone was very simple process. I would buy again from this seller.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,I'm in love with this phone,Phone is small but everything about it is great everything works perfect
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Producto con conprado,Cumple con lo ofrecido la única observación es no detallar con que batería viene solo dice excelente reacondicionado y vino con 85%
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Nice phone.,I like the applications on the phone. Thought it would be a little bigger but I'm getting use to it.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,One of the best purchase I made this year….,Received the phone 2 days early…No scratches no cracks. The phone looks brand new. just hated that the stores in my area doesn’t carries the iPhone 14 Pro cell phone cases.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,Great purchase!,Showed up two days earlier than expected thanks to FedEx. Was super easy to do the iPhone to iPhone transfer and got it working in less than 30 mins! Would recommend this option for buying newer iPhones than some pesky contract BS with a company/carrier. Personally use straight talk and it works amazing!
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Fair Purchase,"Overall, this is a good purchase. The iPhone 14 pro came scratch-free (super-clean). My only complaint is that battery-life is 86%. The product worked as described by the seller."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Almost flawless,"Phone looks like it’s been in a case and screen protector it’s whole life, not a single scratch or blemish on it, I have nothing I can see physically that’s wrong with it, only complaint is the battery health came at 91% but that may vary phone by phone, but it was a well and good purchase and I recommend for anyone looking for the pro iPhone and doesn’t have 1299$ to spend on one, 8.5/10"
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Good,Had some scratches I think as excellent it could still be cleaner…
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,highly recommend!!,so far so good my seller watch the Tech Exange one it came with a screen protector already on in a box with a charger. no hassle about putting the phone on a plan! the battery capacity was at 85% not bad. plus there was like 2 minor scratches that are barley noticeable and the sides of the phone have a little wear. but that’s it it’s complete worth it. don’t let the other reviews scare you away from a great purchase! and it came very fast with prime.
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,iPhone 14 Pro,iPhone sin rasguño y nada malo pensé que me lo dieron nuevo completamente me salió a 93% de carga algo muy bueno mucha gente se espera 100% pero no yo la verdad ya con este tengo 2 iPhone 14 Pro este que es blanco y uno que es negro este me gusta más lo recomiendo
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Muy lindo en teléfono sin rayones impecable,Sólo que la batería vino en solo 89% por eso no le pongo 5 estrellas

B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Esperaba una calidad mejor,"El estado de la batería es 89%, tienen varios rasguños en los lentes un pequeño golpe en la parte superior de la pantalla y un rasguño en la pantalla al lado izquierdo abajo, en rendimiento me parece bien y se comporta bien, sin embargo esperaba más al seleccionar renovado excelente premium."
B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),5,100% satisfecho,"Esta en perfectas condiciones. Estaba un poco nervioso por algunos comentarios, pero estoy completamente satisfecho con la compra. funciona perfecto. Llego con un 87% de condiciones de batería.Este tipo de productos siempre es una lotería. Pero en mi caso en particular ha valido completamente la pena.

B0BN95FRW9,Apple iPhone 14 Pro 128GB (Renewed),4,Battery 90%,"The phone is good, everything is perfect, is unlock so I can use it with a lot of companies. Screen and cameras are perfect good. No scratches or bumps. The only thing is that I paid for perfect condition and the battery was in 90%, I have it for 3 months and now is in 87% and even though I always a care about that. But it was good price too. I bought another one and the battery was 99%, so it’s good luck sometimes"

B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned,"If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this. It is worth every dollar."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Great little present,"Bought for my husband, for home use. The 2024 MacBook Air with the M3 chip is a fantastic laptop for anyone who needs a powerful, portable, and stylish machine. Its exceptional performance, stunning display, and all-day battery life make it a top contender in the premium laptop market."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,One of the best laptops for the buck!!,This MacBook is so good. It's lightweight and fast. The gray colour is beautiful. A must buy if you are an Apple fanboy/girl.
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Nice laptop,"I bought this laptop this past November and am very happy with it.  I upgraded from the M1 Airbook and have no regrets.  The MagSafe connector for charging is much better than having to use a USB-C cable.  It's a fast computer and battery life is pretty good.  I don't use it for any heavy duty applications, but just everyday web surfing, email checking, etc."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,My MAC computer,"First time using an apple computer. I love it. SIRI is a very helpful option. The functionality, screen quality, color and sound are exceptional. I guess technical  skills and adaptability are a plus. The price  is very reasonable, for the quality.  Less expensive than my IPhone."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Great laptop,I know I’m late to the game but this is my first MacBook and I’m beyond happy with my purchase. Great quality and easy set up. I highly recommended this laptop.
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,"Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.Specs-I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)Size-I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.Good luck, everyone!"
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Great laptop,This has been a great laptop for work purposes. It is fast with zoom and to complete work. The camera has been good quality for zooming.
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),4,Screen is Damaged after little useage,"I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop.  I have had one in the past and it worked out well.  This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use.  (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.).  It’s also heavier than I remembered.  It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Excellent Purchase,"I waited a couple of months before I posted this review. I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments.All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks"
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),4,"Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!"
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,the best deal to get macOS AND Windows in your bag.,"M3 / 16gb macbook air with full 1 yr apple warranty for hundreds less. Came factory sealed in original packaging. With my usage - about 2 hours a day - i charge it less than once a week.Installed VMware Fusion (free) and Windows 11 for ARM and now have both environments in a very long lasting and super portable package. Even with windows running and giving 8gb to both OS'es, I do not feel any sluggishness on either side. Having no fan means I dont have to worry about sitting it on my lap."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Finally transitioned from Windows to Apple ..,"Having all the Apple products (iPhone, iPad, iwatch) decided might as well transition to an Apple laptop so that I can have everything “sync”d. As expected , setup was easy and all apps/settings from iPhone were easily sync’d.Just the perfect size, light and enough battery hours.No complains based on the easy of use."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,I’m in LOVE!,"Not only did Amazon beat everyone’s price, it’s my dream replacement! It took a little while to reach me but it was the holidays.I don’t need to review Apple products because they are what they are, which is excellent!"
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Most important thing is to load files and then apps.,"Great product, transferred my files from my Mac Pro. Had a problem with migrating all my files but the apple tech support was great! Load your files first and then your apps and everything worked fine."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Love it! :),"I've had this computer for about 2 months now and I love it. I use it more for school and craft stuff. I wish the storage were a little bit more for the price but it is worth it! I've had an 8 GB one for a while, but when that died down I needed a new one and this was worth every penny. No issues with the setup and also transferring over files from my old Macbook to this one."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Love my Mac,This is the perfect size laptop for me. It is light weight so it's easy to take with me whether I am commuting back and forth from the office or traveling.  It fits easily into all of my work bags.  I am a fan!
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Apple 2024 MacBook Air 13,Wife loves her new 2024 MacBook Air. This replaced her MacBook Air 13-inch from 2013. Huge improvement for her. Only reason we replaced her 2013 Air was it was 11yrs old and Apple could no longer upgrade the iOS. Won't buy anything but a Mac!
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Mackbook,I do the jump from my 2017 apple MacBook to the M3 and the speed the weigh and the system is another level. Amazon make it easy to buy it on the Cyber Monday with good prices and the Apple care bundle.
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,"Mi primer Macbook, excelente experiencia!","mas de 20 años usando windows y este año decidí pasarme al ecosistema de apple. No ha sido una transición fácil, los comandos y las costumbres marcan, sin embargo los beneficios han sido muy notorios:Inicio inmediato del sistema, ningún lag pese a que uso múltiples exploradores y programas al tiempo, imagen impecable, muy buena duración de batería, excelente integración con tu iPhone, conectividad perfecta.Sobre el color, es muy elegante y me ha gustado mucho, con los case combina muy bien y no molesta para las huellas sobre el material.Por mejorar podría ser el material de las teclas que asume un desgaste de huella prematuro y se va viendo brillante, aunque veo que es fácil y económico comprarlas y cambiarlas con los años."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Must buy!!),"Wow such a gorgeous laptop. It’s fast, easy to use, and high quality. I love how it connects to my apple watch and my iphone.

B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,"This laptop is AMAZING! (Silver MacBook Air M3 16GB RAM, 256 GB Storage)","What a laptop! I love this machine. The 16 GB ram is superb for users who are just browsing the web, using this machine for work, watching videos, etc. If you are dependent for heavier workloads consider either the 24 GB RAM model or a base MacBook Pro. Right now the RAM is being used around 8-10 GB out of 16 GB. So thankful apple upgraded their RAM to 16 GB for free. This laptop won't let you down."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Tool for life,"It's an Apple laptop: everything works great.  The touchpad is perfect and keyboard woes are well in the past (butterfly can trigger).

B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,It's exactly as you expect,"This is my first Mac purchase, my second on Amazon, and my second time shipping to my country.

B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Excellent laptop!,I ‘m still using my 7 year old MacBook though the battery life has decreased some.  This new model has a slightly smaller case but the screen is a little larger.  I’m loving it!
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,LOVE My MacBook,"This is my first MacBook and I LOVE it. I've never had a MacBook before and when I first started using it I was very frustrated. It definitely takes some getting used to, but now I love it. Automatically syncs from my iPhone and I love the finger print feature that signs me into any account. I'm really glad I went with the 13 inch option because it's big enough without being bulky."
B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),5,Perfect laptop,"Excellent quality and exactly what you'd expect from Apple, but at a much bigger savings than in the Apple Store.  Very happy that we purchased this from Amazon."

B0DLHTTWVB,Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2024),4,High quality but questionable value and compatibility,"I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- ""Just works"" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in ""Midnight"" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem."

Had to replace my old Macbook as the screen and battery was becoming faulty. In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs."

B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,"Wow, impressive upgrade","There’s a bit of possible Sony hate going on in some reviews, like others I got burned on a pair of WF-10004XM refurbished and one of the batteries started failing after a year. Wasn’t worth the cost of repair. Have others from QCY and Soundcore that were surprisingly good for less cost. Also had trouble with refurbished headphones WH-1000XM4, luckily had added insurance. Cut to buying a new pair that have been flawless.Got the Sony WF-C700N a couple months ago to scratch my earbud itch. Very good for the price. If you’re not ready to throw down $300 for the XM5 they’re a great alternative. Not quite as musical, but no gripes anyway. You can get picky about the throwback buttons but oh well.One comment before I get more specific on the XM5. I fully agree with another review that calls out Sony for how complicated their Sony Connect app has become. It could be simplified for people who don’t want to get into the tech so much.Now, how do they sound? I’m impressed and I’m not using them to their full potential. Using with iPhone so Bluetooth SBC codec is the most basic and lowest quality solution (after digging into the codec question a bit more it does appear that the iPhone has the AAC codec also). However, with the help of Sony’s equalizer and DSEE function I’m very happy with the sound. I almost don’t want to try them with a better codec and then have to go back. (Still applies with AAC, DSE does improve sound)I need treble boost for my old ears and having played bass no surprise I like a lot of bass. These don’t disappoint. I did an A-B comparison with the XM4 headphones and they didn’t have quite the low end but good and punchy with good definition between bass and drums.both can become nice and “growly” on the low end.Noise cancellation is very good, not as good as the headphones but after only a couple days I have been quite satisfied so far.Comfort level is better than the XM4 buds, but I’m so pissed I wasted the money now I don’t want to dig them out to compare audio! I think Sony really improved the fit and design to be lighter, more comfortable, and have impressive sound. Let’s just hope they found a better battery.Used overnight and had battery left in the morning but playing audiobook on timer so i couldn’t say how long continuous playback.I’ll update after I’ve had them longer.(Update) battery life seems to be very similar to the XM4. Sometimes I have battery left in the morning sometimes it comes up short.Another follow up, comes with 4 sets of tips but apparently I have very large ear canals as I’m unable to get a complete seal with the included buds. The large felt good at first but when I used the connect app to check for airtight seals I could not get them to seal. Fortunately I have many tips I’ve saved over the years and by mixing, matching, and testing I have a couple that seal. I even tried ordering extra large tips from a couple vendors and they didn’t work either. Nice that Sony is including extra small but what about us with extra large needs! I do have a possible solution on the way, find a video on YouTube that shows how to use Sugro glue rolled up and inserted in the mushroom part of the tip. Press in the ear to get a fit and then allow to cure over night. Hoping it works, I have a few tips I’d like to try this on. Was even investigating custom molded tips but for $150 plus I’ll try the Sugro hack…8/5/23 tried the Sugro hack yesterday. Still have to work to get an airtight fit but it definitely helped.My opinion on the sound has not diminished. Excellent with what I listen too. A lot of classic rock but also new material from Elle King and others. Listening to Lourdes “Royals” a very deep bass which presents low, solid, and clear. You can easily distinguish the bass and drums. The low rumbling bass of Pink Floyd “Welcome to the Machine” couldn’t be much better in any buds. Almost like I could feel it.I’m now using the WF-C700n as my workout and dog walking buds. Sound signature is very similar but the bass is not quite as good. One thing they are lacking is the airtight fit check in the app. I had to use other tips and the Sugro mold hack to get a good consistent fit in both. The included tips are worthless to me and my big ears.I see a lot of criticism of the noise cancellation for the XM5. I have no way to measure so it’s pretty subjective but I’m not disappointed. At least as good as the XM4. But with any ANC earbuds the airtight seal is critical.If you’re not ready to throw down $300 the WF-C700n are a very good alternative, but are not touch controlled, a single button on each side. Not quite as good on the low end but not disappointing either. In direct comparison you can hear the difference.I still think these are 5 star worthy. I’d take off half a star because of the somewhat complex app but if you like to tinker with the sound and features, give it back. People who are not “technical minded” may find it intimidating. I find it useful but jammed with some features I wouldn’t normally use, like automatically changing settings depending on location as an example. Some might find it useful but not me. The equalizer and clear bass functions are excellent. DSEE function makes a noticeable difference in sound quality. Happier with these than I was with the XM4. Just hope the batteries last, I would hope Sony changed from the $70 replacement cost batteries (not including labor) used in the XM4 as apparently so many people had problems with them dying out after a few months.9/22/23Used these today instead of the WF-C700n for my indoor cycling and to walk the dog. Usually I do those activities with the cheaper buds as for $300 I want to take every precaution to protect them. So…more feedback on the ANC. Definitely a difference on the bike with 2 pretty loud blower fans on. The WF-C700n does a very good job in the same situation but I could definitely tell a difference. Could hardly hear the fans at all and the WF-1000XM5 does have the superior sound performance. Note these blowers are loud enough that if I have my Apple Watch to close to them I get the over 90db warning. They’re not 90db from the bike but they are loud. These cancelled almost all the noise. With volume on my music I don’t hear the fans at all."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Darn near perfection.,"I have used pretty much every credible earbud in the last few years. Sony, Apple, Beats, Bose, B&W, Samsung, Klipsch, M&D, and more. I have also used every generation of Sony buds. In terms of overall use and features, these are not a giant change from the last gen XM4 buds. However, there are significant improvements in key areas. Here is the breakdown:Sound: There are moderate sound improvements here, over the last generation Sony's, which were already close to class leading. Sony put a larger driver in here and it makes a difference. Additionally, Sony added a lot of processing horsepower here. The put in their latest chip for audio, but then added a separate chip to handle all of the ANC duties. Sony argues, that by separating the tasks here, they were able to more finely tune the audio. You can hear the difference. Bass is thumping, highs are even more crisp, and the mid vocals definitely pop more. I am no audiophile but these are really good. To me, these sound better than the latest Bose and Airpod Pro buds. You have to get into the really high-end audio companies to find sound this good. As always, you get Sony's LDAC here if you can use it for high-end audio options and the DSEE Extreme tech that upscale regular more compressed audio. The DSEE really shines here. Your Spotify or Apple music app has never sounded so good. I think most folks will be very satisfied with what Sony has done here and, at the end of the day, sound quality is a big reason to make such an investment.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): These are the best ANC buds Sony has ever made which is saying something. They were already 1b to the latest from Bose, but these have improved dramatically to me. The new dedicated chip just gets it done. These buds adjust the ANC to the noise around you. I honestly hear pretty much nothing other than my music when I have these in. The latest Quiet Comfort's from Bose are still at least as good to me in this arena, but that is pretty much the only area that Bose still is really on equal footing. At least in my opinion. Fit really determines great ANC, so while these are great, there is definitely some subjectivity that comes into play here. I think most will be very happy with the results they get here though.Form Factor: This is an area that Sony has absolutely nailed it and I am going to just say, FINALLY! Every bud Sony has made has always had an asterisk for me. ""They sound so good but they just aren't that comfortable"" was what I often told folks. Not anymore. Sony has made these buds significantly smaller and by adding the glossy interior, has created a bud I hardly notice in my ear. They have gone from a ""yeah but"" to a class leader in the fit and comfort space. I really cannot emphasize enough how good these are. These buds have an IPX4 rating so they should handle the gym with no issues. Sony has included a revised version of their hybrid foam tips from last year and they are great. They just hold the buds in snug and really help block ambient sound. Just so so good Sony. Thank you for the thoughtful redesign. I also want to give Sony a nod for the case redesign. Same battery (3 charges) but much smaller. I love it.Battery and Connectivity: The battery life is the same from last year. About 7 to 8 hours of real use. It is fine. Not class leading but not bad either. Connection here is BT 5.3 so the latest. Same as last gen. However, Sony said that these buds will be LE compatible when they finally start rolling this out over the coming year so you can expect even better sound and perhaps even battery life someday soon. This essentially future proofs these buds.Call Quality: Not much to say here other than these are about as good as it gets. Sony added bone conductive tech here and you can tell. Your calls sound great.Intangibles: There are too many features to unpack here. You really need to read all that Sony has packed into these. From the upscaling audio, to one touch audio play, to speak to pause tech to gestures and so so so much more. You can literally get lost in the app. Almost too much is going on here. Regardless, there is almost nothing that these buds can't do. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Sony has multipoint connection option here as well. It is only two devices, so there are more robust options out there, but this should be fine for most in real life application. Very good stuff.So, should you buy these? If you are an Android user, the answer is 100% yes. Apple users have to consider that Airpods are more tightly integrated into their space. Further, Apple is getting ready to launch their high end sound codec as well, which these will not support. They are still worth considering though as Sony has just made a better sounding product. To me, these might be the best all around buds I have ever tried. From sound to calls to comfort, Sony has just nailed all of it. There are companies that offer buds that do one thing better perhaps, but none are as complete as these in my opinion. So, yes, buy these. You will not regret it. I will update as I go here."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Almost perfect (don't like the foam tips),"I have over-the-ear Sony's but wanted something for the gym, that's right I work out. These are very light and unobtrusive, the sound is fine, probably too bass heavy for audiophiles but you can adjust, noise canceling is okay--I'm using the biggest of the foam tips because I want a tight fit to keep them secure *and* to help block noise, but the foam is just not dense enough so it never feels that secure and you get sound leakage the ANC can't block. Seems incredible to produce this high-tech wizardry and then cheap out on the foam so it ruins the effectiveness but come on, I'm sure that $0.000013 savings adds up."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,1,Great as headphones but...,"I've used WF1000XM4s for a while before upgrading to these in July of 2023. In fact, I ordered 2 of them so that when 1 pair died, I'd have another pair to use. Excessive, but effective. However, much like the XM4s, I think there are some quality control problems. By February, the first pair (XM5s) I ordered started acting up. It was having issues with voice calls where people would say they could not hear me at all no matter what I did, I went through all the troubleshooting steps with Sony and they told me to send the faulty pair to them. Which is okay, this stuff happens, but I also had problems with the XM4s that made me also go back to Sony support as well. the problems with my XM4s were that they would not charge and drained too quickly, as well as have problems where one of the buds would stop playing sound completely.So, I wanted to try the XM5s to see if all these issues were fixed. To be fair, they were fixed. The battery drain isn't quick, the sound quality is better, battery life overall and uneven draining is improved. They are a step up from the XM4s and I can confirm that. However, there are some issues with the XM5s currently. First of all, the call quality seems to be bugged out as my second pair has started to have issues just like the first. I’ve been using these comply tips and it could be the tips themselves but for whatever reason, there is a significant muting of sounds when the headphones are in vs when are out which didn’t seem to be the case before. It seems that these headphones have a problem with longevity and the quality control is pretty consistently not up to par with the price.It's a shame that in my review of headphones, it took this long to get to the sound quality of the headphones themselves. The EQ settings have been improved and you get some more curation based on your preferences. I think for BT, they sound great, Early into getting the pair, there were moments where it was so clear, I had to pop a bud out to make sure the sounds weren’t coming from somewhere else.The multipoint connections are still a little buggy.  I would have them connected to my phone and desktop and I’d get spammed by a message asking me to go back to my last used device. Only way to remedy this issue was to block that notification. For these reasons and issues, I just can’t recommend paying for these headphones unless they’re under a hefty discount. I don’t think you can justify the price while having all these glaring issues. The quality control and reliability of these headphones is extremely subpar and this has persisted through the XM4s and continues, unfortunately into the lifecycle of the XM5s.Update: mic issue has persisted and cannot get them to work anymore. I am constantly plagued by issues with the headphones that I favor the EAH-AZ80s over them as they are much more reliable. I do not recommend these headphones at all."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Bluetooth connection issues w/ PC, ANC isn't as good as Bose","Short version:- ANC is pretty good but the ANC is definitely better on the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds- These are fine for use with a phone, but they absolutely suck at connecting to a PC- Case is nice and small, wireless charging is a nice feature, fit is good (they don't fall out of your ear), and sound quality is greatDetailed version:1) ANCIf you're buying for the ANC noise cancelling then skip these and buy the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds. I have both and the ANC is noticeably better on the Bose. All I care about is ANC and I couldn't tell from reviews which one was actually going to be better. Bose is better.I mainly use them during lunch in different restaurants to block out people talking and whatever music the restaurant is playing. I don't know why there's mixed reviews about this. Having tried both, Bose is clearly better. I did tons of reading and research and it's hard to get a clear answer for some reason. I don't even have the Bose QuietComfort Ultra II, I have the original ones (although I read that Bose didn't change the ANC between those models).There's 2 minor downsides to the Bose ones compared to these:A) On the Bose ones, when you're not playing any audio there is an extremely faint hum in the background. As soon as you play any audio it's gone, but these Sony ones don't have any hum when you're not playing audio.B) With the Bose ones, if you have ANC on and you get in your car and shut the door, something about the air pressure change makes the Bose ones make an annoyingly loud popping sound. These Sony ones don't do that.I tried every earbud attachment with the Sony, including the silicon ones they ship you for free when you complain the standard ones don't work. I tried both in multiple environments. In every situation Bose blocks outside noise better.2) Connecting to a PCConnecting to your PC Bluetooth for the first time is so counterintuitive it's absurd. You won't be able to do it without looking up step by step instructions. Then once they are connected, they have all kinds of problems. Using one set of bluetooth earbuds and the battery died? Want to switch quickly to these Sony earbuds mid game or mid TV show? No. No quick switching at all. I usually have to restart my computer to get them to actually work. They'll say ""connected"" but I won't have any sound. Apparently Windows doesn't support whatever codec Sony uses and you can buy an alternative driver/codec thing but that's ridiculous. If you spend this kind of money on earbuds they should just seamlessly work with any modern bluetooth device.They work fine with my phone (Android) so if that's all you're using them for then you'll be fine. There's an app I downloaded to update the firmware on the earbuds but then I deleted it since the features seem pointless and I'm sure they datamine with it.3) The sound quality is obviously very good, but that's to be expected. Between these and the Bose I don't notice much a difference, music sounds great on both. I don't use either for calls so I haven't really tested the microphone.The charging case is nice and small. Very pocket size, I liked that, and I like that it has wireless charging (the Bose case does not charge wirelessly). The fit is good, I don't notice them even after extended use. They come with 4 different sizes of earbuds that are all a kind of stiff foam.If you go in the app settings you can do a seal test where it runs some kind of test to determine if the fit and seal in your ear is good. If you get it to say the seal is not good (before running the test don't press them firmly in your ears, just have them barely not falling out then do the test) then on the screen where it says the seal isn't good there's a link you can click that takes you to an order page where you can put in your address and they'll ship you 4 more earbuds that are soft silicon instead of foam for free.Overall I'm not happy with them. For how pricey they are I shouldn't have to deal with Bluetooth connection issues with a brand new Windows 11 laptop. At this price point I should get perfection, and at the very least they should be easy to use. I've spent way too long troubleshooting the connection issues with my computer.I highly recommend Bose QuietComfort Ultra instead of these, especially if you're main reason for buying them is noise cancelling."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Fantastic!,"I bought these because I had a gift card to spend, and in hopes that I could completely separate from my Airpod Pro’s (1rst gen). I wanted to get rid of my Airpod pro’s because I have become so completely fed up with popping them in my ears and having only one earbud connect. That happens about 25% of the time I use them, and of course it’s always right when I’m in a hurry and need them now. I have to reset them every time it happens and frankly I’m fed up with it – unacceptable reliability.So, it’s only been a little more than a week but I haven’t had this happen once. Nor has it ever happened on any of my other true wireless earbuds (Soundcore Liberty 4 NC’s and some cheap no-name sports hook-style earbuds). The Sony’s have had stellar reviews, but my one reservation was that I’m in a full Apple ecosphere, and I had read that if you’re in the Apple ecosphere, you’ll want the Airpod Pro series II. Using anything else would mean missing out on that typical Apple integration – things work great together. Well, I’ve never tried the Airpod Pro II’s, but I couldn’t get myself to reward Apple by ordering another pair of headphones from them after my dissatisfaction with the AirPod Pro I’s.So, how are the Sony’s? Absolutely fantastic and boy, am I glad I went with them! First of all, in terms of integration/functionality with my Apple world, best I can tell so far its flawless. Transitions between my iPhone 15 and iPad Pro are just as smooth as my AirPods were. I can send/receive calls just as easily, and the Sony has one feature I don’t think AirPods have – you can just nod your head to answer calls! I also find the touch sensor vastly superior to Apple’s squeeze surface (or whatever it’s called). Much more intuitive to me, and it works every time on the first try.Another big advantage the Sony’s have over the Airpod Pro I’s is battery life. One reason I picked the Sony’s was better sleep. My wife makes quite a racket sleeping at night and I had read that these were great for sleeping. My Airpod Pro’s were also quite good at that, but they wouldn’t last through the night – only about 4.5 hours (w/NC on). Not sure how long the Sony can last, but I’ve gone over 8 hours (w/NC on) – and they still had some battery left! As for the noise cancelling, I’d say it’s slightly disappointing. I also own the over-ear WH-1000XM5’s, and they have AWESOME noise cancelling! I’d say the WF-1000XM5’s are nowhere near that level – I’d say they are about the same as my Airpod Pro I’s. Good enough to attenuate my wife’s snoring (at least enough that I can sleep), but not completely block it (so I hear nothing at all) as on the WH-1000XM5’s. But of course, the WH-1000MX5’s are way too big to sleep with (full size over-ear headphones). Another minor disappointment is no “find my earbud” functionality, which makes me a little paranoid about losing them, but hopefully not a big deal.Saving the best for last is the sound quality. I bought the big-brother WH-1000XM5’s a year ago and was quite surprised at their sound quality. Same thing here – these sound fantastic! I’m a fairly serious audiophile and have quite a collection of high-end headphones, including one pair of earbuds that are more than triple the cost of these Sony’s (JH Audio J13 v2’s). And all the electronics to go with it (DAP’s, DAC’s, amps, cables, etc.). They took a while to break in properly (maybe 30-50 hours) but they are really wonderful. They are among the most natural sounding earbuds I’ve heard and I’m a bit stumped how that could be possible since it uses crappy Bluetooth. My high-end headphones are fed almost exclusively high-rez files. Bluetooth AAC (can’t use LDAC on an iPhone) is the best I can run, which of course are only a small fraction the bitrate resolution of true high-rez files. But somehow these sound absolutely wonderful – just a natural “rightness” that’s hard to describe. BY FAR the best bass I’ve ever heard from an earbud. They have a confidence, an “assertiveness” (yes, that’s a new audio metaphor) – not aggressiveness - that I just love. I’m not saying that they are flat-out better than my high-end earbuds (my Shure M535’s are my favorite), but I will say they are at least in the same ballpark. I can pop these in and really enjoy listening for hours – and not feel like I’m missing out in not using my much more expensive earbuds. Very high compliment indeed! So, great job Sony! BTW, I read that Sony bought Audeze (high-end true audiophile headphone brand), which means I can’t wait to see what they come out with in the future – if these are as good as they are, I can’t wait to find out what the XM6’s or XM7’s will sound like!Update 4/16/24: Just wanted to mention one more remarkable thing about these. I am an avid cyclist and I’ve been on a long search to find the best earbuds for cycling - which for me, is mostly about reducing WIND NOISE. That is by far my biggest goal for cycling headphones. These are downright spooky in their ability to hugely reduce wind noise - BY FAR the most effective I’ve ever tried, and I’ve tried quite a few (AirPod Pro’s, Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, etc…). So now I face an interesting dilemma - do i dare use a $300 pair of earbuds for cycling? The problem with using them for cycling is that cycling is of course brutal on earbuds (constant sweat). So I’ll have to decide if I dare to do that long term, but I can say that these are by far the best headphones I have ever used in terms of wind blocking. So these really are amazing - fantastic sound, powerful noise cancelling, long battery life and the best wind noise blocking I’ve ever heard…"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,2,Shockingly bad user experience...,"I've used many different brands of earbuds, and for the price, these are probably the worst I've used, to a degree I'm struggling to comprehend. Let's get one thing out of the way: they sound good. It's better than my AirPods Pro 2s. Everything else, and I mean everything else, is so much worse. Let's start at the top.These things are so slippery that I struggle to get them out of the case without dropping them. And for me, the shape is hard to get into my ears. Also, the case feels cheap. They charge $300 for these?Setup is a chore. You are required to use the app to access any of its features. And boy, is it a piece of work. From opening the app to first listening to anything took just over an hour. AN HOUR! You must log into a Sony account to get most of the high-end features to work, which is nonsense. And lord help you if you had a Playstation account 15 years ago. I appreciate the trouble Sony has gone to for security, but I had to do a 10-part captcha from hell twice to get into the account. And the translation to English in the app is poor at best, making the whole experience a head-scratching mess. The device pairing process is easy, however.The noise canceling is about as good as my 70-dollar no-name Chinese buds. Seems better at high-pitched things than general background noise, which is a strange feat as the former is much harder to pull off. I struggle to hear dogs barking, but my AC is as clear as a bell. The ambient pass-through is barely acceptable, not even in the same league as the AirPod Pros. Your voice tends to be over-amplified and slightly delayed, making talking to and understanding others a mess. The feature that mutes whatever you are listening to and turns off ANC when you start talking is hit or miss. It works about half the time when I start talking. The other half kicks on when any noise is picked up. Very annoying.Now, the reason I purchased these is Multipoint Bluetooth. This feature lets devices connect to multiple devices simultaneously and quickly switch between them. It's crucial for any work that has you bouncing between phone calls and working on a PC. Let me tell you, Sony's implementation is worse than useless. Can I connect to two devices? Sure. Can I stay connected to two devices? Absolutely not. When they are connected, does it switch seamlessly between the two? Also, absolutely not. If one is already making a sound, the other device can't be changed without silencing the first device. So, say you are listening to YouTube on your PC and get a call. To switch to the call, pause YouTube and anything else making sound, then answer the call. And about 50% of the time, it will switch. Otherwise, you have to change it manually. What is even the point? Even more fun is that the second device can't be switched to after some time, between 5 minutes and who knows how long, without manually going into settings and reconnecting first. Then you get another 5 minutes to a couple of hours of flaky ""fast switching"".The battery life is an actual lie. They claim 8 hours, but with all features turned off except playback, I got closer to 6. With ANC on, I may have gotten 4-5 hours. Each bud's battery seems to drain at different speeds as well. So, while one may have 10% left, the other is already dead.I would be less critical if these were $100 instead of $300. Crucially, though, even at $100, I would still return them. Other than sounding great, they are terrible to use. And for $100, I can get earbuds that sound just as good but aren't so finicky.In closing, I'm surprised Sony released such a poor product. They're so bad that it's tarnished my view of the company."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Excellent sound ... if you find the right tips.,"These are really some of the best earbuds currently in the market. Sound was lackluster at first because none of the included ear tips worked for me. That foam material that Sony uses doesn't work for all people, perhaps that's why other manufacturers like Apple, Sennheiser and B&W use silicone tips (which also are easier to clean and age better). Once I bought compatible silicone ear tips (link below), I got a good seal and was able to truly enjoy these earbuds.Pros:- Excellent sound quality. I would say they sound better than Apple AirPods Pro.- The mobile App includes an equalizer to tune them exactly the way you want them.- Last firmware allows you to use head gestures to control them.- Full-featured mobile App.- Construction is great. Both the earbuds and case are solidly built.- Good noise cancellation- Smaller and lighter than the previous version.Cons:- Although noise cancellation is good, it's not as good as Apple's AirPods Pro.- Mobile App is a little convoluted to navigate, but it's not too bad.Neutral:- Although they are smaller than the previous version, they still protrude out of your ears more than other offerings like Apple AirPods. They are on-par to other offerings like Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3 and B&W, so it's not too bad.These are the ear tips I used. They work great:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0989NHFGW"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,"Immersive stellar sound, quirky fit","8/8/24 update: I replaced the Sony OEM earbud tips with the Sedna Earfit Max, the ML size. Wonderful fit. Never a problem with air tightness. Sony is still sending me some alternate earbud tips for free. I have no idea how they'll work but I'm getting them mid-month.  Sony's sound quality is spoiling the p30i's for me but I'm still keeping them as a backup._____________________I had a pair of XM4s that crapped out on the left earbud after eight months. Was able to return them and get a refund. I replaced them with Anker Soundcore p30i's as a stopgap until Prime Day. I really like them for the most part. And for the price the sound is great. But I can't help remembering the sound of the XM4, although I wasn't sure if I was like building it up in my mind to an unrealistic degree. I wasn't.I just bought these on Prime day. I was really happy with the p30is and I still am. But the sound of the XM5s are so good, compared to the great at the price sound of the p30i's. XM5 sound is immersive, clear, round, rich, and beautiful whether I'm listening to opera, EDM, or K-pop. No flatness or separation between me and the sound. It's just so good in my head.Fit-wise the Sony earbuds are really hard to get airtight and I tried a couple of tip sizes. I recall with the XM4 I had to wait for the tips to warm up in my ears before they became airtight.  I have some replacement silicone ear tips, nothing special. Just some cheapies I had bought for the p30i but they didn't fit. These work better with the XM5 with the air tightness. Not quite sure whether the sound is as good as with the OEMs, so I'll have to compare.I'm going to keep the p30i as my second pair. You just can't go wrong at the price and the quality (and the battery life). They were a replacement for the Soundcore p40i which just didn't fit my ears at all and would fall out regardless of the size of ear tips I used.  But I have a feeling that the longer I keep listening with these XM-5s I'm going to have to get used to accepting or tolerating a not as great sound the the p30i delivers .For the price, the p30i are really good. Is the XM5 worth like $170-ish more? Yeah, I think so. My ears are so happy with this sound.Fit-wise the p30i don't fit any better than the XM5 But so far they haven't fallen out like the p40i did. Soundcore earbuds have tails and I'm really not used to them. And they tend to stick out of my ears a little bit more. The angle at which I have to put the earbuds in is a little weird for me. But it's acceptable and as I said, for the price, the sound is really great. Just not as great as the XM5.ANC- meh on the Soundcores (although they have good sound isolation); better on Sony.Controls- definitely better on Sony. Every time I touched the  the Soundcores to adjust them in my ears (which I had to do a lot with the p40i), it would change something in the settings.Battery life- p40i long battery life was one of the key reasons why I bought them. The p30i isn't bad either, just not quite as long as the p40i, But I've been getting three or four charges out of the case before hitting 20% on the buds and have to charge the case again. I don't know how long the XM5 lasts. But I do remember what the XM4 battery life kept shortening. I was only getting about 3 or 4 hours after a while. So I will be looking at that.UPDATE: getting good battery life from the Sony's. I can use the charging case three times before I have to recharge the whole thing. And I can just recharge the case alone. Usually I can have these in my ears for like 6 hours before I get a low battery which happens at 20%.I'm subtracting a star for price and that sort of quirky fit."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,"Impressive sound, Subpar ANC","I've been doing a lot of research lately. I've been running with Bose QC (1st Gen) buds for a couple years now. Aside from running into a few minor hiccups I'll attribute to age, I've been more the satisfied with them. However, they are rather bulky and I do a lot of physical labor for work. It was time for a change. After a couple months of searching, I decided to try out the Sony x5's.Out of the box I was immediately impressed by the size. Everyone in my house has airpod pros, so smaller earbuds aren't new, but these were pleasantly small. The case was also a welcome sight. My QC1's aren't only bulky, the case is probably 3 times larger. Knowing I won't have to carry that around in my pocket anymore was already making me happy with the decision. I'm also liking the wireless charging. This was one of the things that kept me away from the Bose QC Ultras(if I'm spending almost $300, I shouldn't have to spend another $70 for a feature that should be standard in 2024).Like I said, I was kind of rushed during setup, which may have had an effect on this next take. But setup was much more in depth than I was expecting. Having to switch between multiple apps and sign ons was slightly off putting. But there was never a clear explation of why I was doing this. Having google assistant is a cool feature. But I don't use it. And there was no walk through for Alexa. Also the push to use 360 audio(which is incredible, but more on that in a minute) was also confusing. You would think for how many steps you go through to get these setup, a lot of which are optional features, there would be some sort of ""quick start"" guide. But you're left to figure out the touch controls on your own. Speaking of, there doesn't seem to be any way to alter these, other than the long press option which is really just a short cut and not a real ""device control "". By the time I was done I only had about 10 minutes to listen to some music and cycle different sound settings before putting the kids to bed. However, I can honestly tell you that my initial reaction was not love. I wasn't displeased, but for the price, I'd hoped to be wowed.The next day I had some running around to do so I had more time to play around with them. I will say that while I wasn't overly impressed at first, day 2 made me feel much better about these in a lot of ways. The sound is incredible. The EQ options let you do so much and really do make you feel like you're in the music. The bass isn't quite as strong as I'd hoped, but I could get used to that if I had to.However, and thus probably my biggest issue with these, the Noise Cancelation isn't anywhere near as good as my old Bose buds. With those, I could pop the two in, fire up my gas powered backpack leaf blower and hardly hear a hum. With the sony's, I had a hard time telling sometimes if noise cancelation was on or not. Granted, I did have the voice filtering turned on. But the idea is that it let's voices through but not ambient noise. In reality, it seems like it let's an awful lot of background noise in. I do like that i can switch ANC on and off with a simple touch of the left bud, but while using the mode that detects your current activity (running, sitting, driving etc) and adjusts automatically, I've found that it cuts over ANC mode on its own pretty frequently. These little features are great in theory, but they aren't refined enough at this point to make them useful on a daily basis and serve more as a fluff feature rather than truly useful ones.I still haven't tried out phone calls, which I plan to do tomorrow. But overall, when you consider the price and the competition I'm still not sold on these yet. They are no doubt a great product, fit wonderfully and sound superb. They are probably ideal and good enough for a lot of people. Just not quite convinced they are what I'm look for"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,Ok ear buds with bad mic quality,"I am writing this review as of December 2nd 2024I bought this one on release day because my previous WF1000xm4 ( the previous generation ) stopped working due to the right earbud battery drain issue that affected many users. This version got slight improvements on some stuff but no improvements on other parts.Comfort - the earbuds feel a bit smaller and got a better fit to my ears compared to the previous version. The ear tips got improvements as well, now they have a tiny net inside that prevents anything from reaching the inside of the earbuds. They still use the memory foam pad but I'm not sure if it is the same or not compared to xm4s.Sound Quality - I don't notice any different between xm5 vs xm4 . I use Tidal as my music streaming service. I have prioritize quality setting on the sony app and highest quality streaming on Tidal.The charging case is smaller and easier to carry around. The charging is fairly easy. Now the case have a pairing button instead of holding both earbuds for the last generation. Also for first time pairing, a pop up will show on the screen to set up and connect the device to the phone.Sony headphone app - the app is awful. They have upgraded to a newer version but it is still awful mainly for the updates. I always get notifications on my phone about the battery percentage of the earbuds. Updates have weird requirements and it takes long.Mic quality - I don't use the mic often but i used it a lot during a vacation to call my family/friends without having to hold my phone. I was told that my voice wasn't clear enough and was asked to repeat what i said multiple times. Two times i was told that the mic quality is bad.  I couldn't tell how bad it is, i can't call my self and find out. What I did is that I opened my camera app, selected video recording and chose the mic from the earbud instead of the phone. When I heard the recording, i lt was so flexible l horrible but I'm not sure if that was something wrong with the camera app or what.Connectivity - it is bluetooth. Easy to connect. For first time, open the case and a pop up will show. After that, just open the case and put on the earbuds and they will work. No loss in connection if it was already paired. There is one issue that was in the xm4 and still is in this one . I notice sometimes that when I return the earbuds to the case, they will still be connected to the phone. I had this issue on my previous phone with the same earbuds and never had them with different brands. Sometimes I notice it if I watch a video and no audio comes from my phone speaker but many times I return them to the case and do something else then find out later that they have been connected to my phone and never disconnected then I'd have to charge them again even though they were inside the case. I think sometimes they don't sit right inside the case which causes the issue I'm facing.I'd consider this one if I prefer convenience and comfort over sound/mic quality."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Surprisingly efficient quality buds once I equipped my old silicone tips.,"Edit 01/19/24Short and sweet-I use buds just about everyday.I liked the pixel buds more, and is why my xm4's will not accept a charge or turn on because after getting the pixel buds, I never used the XM4's again.We're here for XM5 though, so please excuse the rant.1st Sony customer service, second to none including Google who used to be pretty good(IMO)(pre-'so-called'pandemic).2nd -Stop right now and take a picture of bottom of XM5 case & package it came in(identifying Numbers). If u ever have issue you will need.3rd & final what you read for---➡️❤️ My original review is below and still valid but after cleaning and adjusting tips, I'm happy to report I haven't had the 'connect from pocket problem'. Changing the tips made a big diff, but they're not near as secure and comfortable as pixel buds pro for my everyday use. That bring said, the pass through, pass thru blend, etc are the best hands down. Their competition isn't even close for this category(IMO_of_course).The only thing I find myself having to adjust often. They want to sit halfway in my ear, instead of locked into place. Many times when I go to adjust, I hit pause, which could be disabled in all fairness. I still use these as my everyday buds though, and are about to try more tips when I can find the time. They are superior in sound and especially the noise cancellation/passthrough/blend feature. It's actually amazing how good they are in all honesty. (If you don't like foam tips, get some silicone because these only come with the foam style.) (The tips are the same though as any other set.)I just wanted to come back and follow up.They deserve five stars.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. I have to leave the one star off but if I could I'd rate them 4.7-4.8, so sorry it's not five stars for a pretty solid product.I hope this can help someone, and give yourself a day or two once getting to be able to see the difference, since they have some pretty solid picks out there. Thanks, & may the good Lord bless.❤️I had the 3rd & 4th Gen earbuds, so upon getting these, I was wondering did I make the right choice, coming from pixel buds pro? I'm happy to report, that after changing the tips to some older silicone traditional Sony tips, they surprised me how nice they were to use. I also was happy about the longer lasting battery, and quality passthrough experience then what I had gotten used to. All in all, these are pleasantly nice once I put the silicone ear tips on. They fit perfect now and have my recommendation. Edit- I've had a little time with them, and the couple things I don't care for so far, is Amazon music service; I disabled nearby devices, because every time I connect buds after accepting update, they offer a service to be ready to play music with a tap. It's good if that's what you want, but not for me at the time. Now the other issue is actually an issue that has me really concerned whether I want to use them long-term. The right ear bud every time I look is connected in the case/paired to my phone which is a dealbreaker if I can't seem to correct. I'm sorry to report this because it's something that matters a lot to me and a reason I would return to the pixel buds pro. Anyway the sound and noise cancellation is second to none , and I can honestly say, they close the pixel buds pro out of the water.  This is the reason I still only subtracted one star for a five star product. Thank you for reaching and sharing your opinion to better help others make their decision."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,"Clear, quiet, smaller and lighter than the XM4","I use a range of Sony headphones and earbuds, from the MDR-Z1R to the IER-M9 to consumer models like the WH-1000XM and WF-1000XM series. It all depends on where I am (at home, on the go locally, or traveling) and what equipment I'm using (a Sony digital music player with a balanced headphone output jack or Bluetooth LDAC support, or a simple iPhone that only supports the Bluetooth AAC codec).My WF-1000XM5 pair arrived July 28, 2023 (the day before I wrote this review). After testing them and completing the initial update to the 2.0.1 firmware (by the time you read this, there may be a newer version), I found that I just left the earbuds in for the rest of the day, whether I was listening to music, making calls, or enjoying some quiet time. They're smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than my WF-1000XM4 pair, to the point that I don't really notice I'm wearing them.Sound-wise, there is a noticeable improvement in bass and in the midrange. I didn't notice much of a difference in treble, although I like less bass and more treble than the average person (hence my choice of the IER-M9 over the two alternatives in that product line).The noise-canceling has improved across the board. As always, it's important to try the different tips, including the possibility that you will need a different size in each ear. I was surprised to see that mentioned in the in-app tutorial!I am used to third-party expanding foam tips for my WF-1000XM4 pair, so we'll see whether third-party vendors offer something similar for the new model. For now, the stock tips work fine. They remind me of the alternate-texture tips that come with the IER-M9.Now, a few flaws, worth mentioning given the price of this product...First, Sony's model numbering is stupid and not consumer-friendly. Normal people can get excited about ""AirPods"" but not about ""WF-1000XM5s"".Second, the charging case, though now significantly smaller, still lacks any sort of finding feature. It would have been a simple matter for Sony to add the ability, through the clunky Headphones Connect app, to make a pair of earbuds in the case play a loud sound so you could find the case if you'd misplaced it. Apple of course makes precisely locating its products very easy.Third, in their hubris, product designers at Sony have made something small and lovely but forgotten about the environments in which it will be used. There is NO tactile feedback to let us distinguish the left earbud from the right. The L and R marks are tiny (just millimeters tall) and the use of dull grey for L and red for R makes them invisible in the dark. If I'm out walking in the evening without the case, have taken off the earbuds for a moment, and am putting them back on, I should not have to use my iPhone's flash to tell left from right.Last but not least, the Headphones Connect app is becoming an ever more elaborate trainwreck. There are just too many options and features. With no distinction between what's essential and what's not, you have to open three tabs in succession, scroll down, and open endless settings panels (each accessed by a gear icon) to cover everything. Pesty notifications come back every time you start the app, even if you deleted them the last time. Sony tries again and again to make you sign up for various accounts, and is of course gathering information about you, your cell phone, and your listening activity every time you use their app. Since Sony's 360 spatial audio only works with a handful of paid, proprietary music apps (a big gap, compared to the more-or-less universal, iOS-level support for this feature with Apple wireless headphones and earbuds), I don't even bother setting it up.Overall, the WF-1000XM5 is an excellent pair of wireless earbuds in terms of sound, noise canceling, and comfort, and Sony could make improvements by renaming them, adding a raised plastic dot to make the right earbud distinguishable by touch, and ditching the Headphones Connect app in favor a lightweight (and ideally, data-privacy-conscious) control panel."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Not as good as I hoped, I am returning them.","I am a big Sony fan with 6 of their top TV models, 4 cameras, and 5 pairs of head and ear phones in our family.  Unfortunately,  I have watched their top of the line designs (TV's and headphones in particular) change from 'cost no object quality products' to designs that are purposely simplified and cheapened to save in manufacturing costs.  A good example is the change from the XM4 headphones to XM5 models with the later looking like a sub $100 pair of headphones with weak pivot points, poor folding size, large case, cheap plastic, and thin bass sound.  Those headphones at least improved the mids and highs...which I cannot say for these WF-1000XM5 earbuds.  It seems Sony finds some great wins, then removes those that work in the next revisions to be different and does not listen to their customers.  An example is the effective voice confirmations in mode changes that now are replaced with beeps and some modes being removed.  This is very helpful in flights, when there is a lot of ambient noise.These WF-1000XM5 earbuds epitomize this cheap concept in being  too slippery (what happened to the nice matt finish in XM4's), awkward to handle and insert, weird fitting in the case as they rock around not making contact, and exuding a boomy cheap sound.  The case seems like it was designed for a different product.  To be clear, I gave them plenty of time to break in and though they improved...they plateaued way too soon.  I understand cost savings are important, but these earphones are $300 and marketed as their best and these do not exude quality like their previous models and this is immediately obvious.  The gloss finish is very slippery, not ideal for handling and looks cheap.  The attractive bronze (rose gold?) accents from the past are all but gone.  They are moderately comfortable but leak sound making you constantly guess whether or not ambient sound is on or off.  Touch control seems more irregular and modes are removed.  Conversely, I have found my XM4's (I have 2 pairs) to sometimes cause mild pain in my ears over long use which I did not experience with these XM5's though the XM5 for me feel like they are falling out with their more rounded shape.The soundstage is muddy and closed in and does not outperform the XM4 earphones, in my opinion.  Some music with perfect recordings sounds OK, but across the board they fall short in getting the  best out of the music and I listen to many types of music.  Just like the WH-1000XM5 headphones (which I returned to keep XM4's), these are no better sounding than their predecessors and for me the sound quality is first and foremost.  Accuracy has always been Sony's forte but I have found that has changed.  I have high end audio equipment including tube amps, and a full home theater so admittingly I might be a little picky; however previous models from Sony have kept me content and not a single flight I take is without their headphones or earphones.The ANC and phone call quality are very good but as the foam does not seal well there is that sound leakage in my ears no matter which tips I tried or how I turned them...meaning many will have to buy aftermarkets right away to get that softer better conforming ear pad...which is not a requirement with many of their competitors.  I truly feel like Sony's design team did not spend enough time to cross the t's and dot the i's for these headphones and the budget was too low for a high quality design.  The battery life is worse than previous models and I tested them side by side with XM4 using the same settings and same volume.  They are smaller...for those who need to save space but I would prefer sound quality improvements over reduction in size.  They are also more efficient with less more volume from a lower setting on my S23 Ultra.I did the prepurchase for these earphones and use my others daily but unfortunately I returned them and will stick with the previous models as I try others...which is disappointing.  I was surprised about the many positive professional reviews and it does make me feel like they could be a little biased."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Worthy upgrade from WF-1000XM4,"I've had a pair of the previous generation XM4s for a couple of years. They were fabulous buds, but the battery life on them started to go way down. It was time to replace them. I decided to give the latest generation a try. Once again, Sony has hit it out of the park with the XM5s. The sound quality and noise cancellation are incredible. The new buds are physically smaller and lighter than the previous ones. The case is slimmed down a bit. The magnets that hold the buds in the case are not as strong, making it easier to get them out. The battery life on these new ones is fantastic!Some of the cons: The bass is a bit more punchy than the old ones, but that's not a huge deal. I just went into my music player app and reduced the bass a little. The buds themselves are very smooth, and can slip out of the fingers pretty easily. Would be nice to have a rubberized coating for more traction. In the Sound Connect app, it would be nice to be able to select a default option for Ambient Sound Control when wearing just one bud.Conclusion: If you have a pair of XM4s that still work, you would do fine to stick with them for the time being. But when they do die, get yourself a pair of XM5s. You'll be pleased!"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Worth It,"I am a long time user of Sony linkbuds and had a few pairs. And out of all the pairs of linkbuds overall they were good but was looking for something better. I got the Bose QC ultras and the noise cancellation on those is unmatched, but the app functionality and headphone connection issues were not like Sonys app or ambient sound control. So I returned the Bose and got these Sony XM5 buds and they are everything I hoped. No issues with them as of yet, the sound quality of the music is definitely an upgrade from the link buds. The app control and what you do with the Sony is still top for me."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Comparison to XM4 and Bose QC2,"I'll keep it brief since others have reviewed more thoroughly.First thing, and I'm shocked to say this-- they actually are tricky to pull out of the case because of the shape and smoothness.  It's unbelievable that a huge company can make a product so good in some ways and then just like, what, not actually try to use it before mass-production?  It's genuinely worth removing a star for.  They could have put just a ring of textured area or a silicone band embedded; or just a little ribbing.  It would have been trivial, and should have been obvious from the first test.I think I read someone say they wanted a way to distinguish between left and right.  There is a small but obvious bump on the left bud, for this purpose.Bose are more comfortable-- there just is no comparison.  If you get a combination of tips and wings that fit your ear, it's like you've got nothing at all in your ear.  It is THAT good.  The Sony XM4 was irritating by kind-of rubbing against the inner ear when fully inserted.  The XM5 have resolved that by being very slightly shorter.  They are comfortable if you are used to in-ear buds, especially well-sealing ones.  They will never be as comfortable as the Bose.XM5 sound quality is very similar to XM4.  I prefer the sound of the XM5 to Bose for almost anything.  The Quietcomfort 2 really emphasizes a kickdrum and then bass is muted.  It's probably somewhat adjustable in the app EQ, but I didn't try.  Percussion like shakers, cymbals, hats, etc all sound more realistic on the XM5 than the Bose-- the Bose makes them sound both synthesized/""fake"" and undefined at the same time.  Mind you, the Sony is not audiophile grade-- if you have nice cans then you will definitely find the Sonys lacking.  But they're great for what they are, and better than the Bose.Bose takes longer to turn on and connect (several seconds), but they take less time to get comfortably situated in the ear.Noise cancellation-- Bose are noticeably (10-15%) better at cancelling white noises (fans, air purifier, airplane).  So for a long-haul flight where that and comfort are most important, the Bose win.  Sony, however, did better at cancelling out sudden noises and voices, as well as background music.  So for the gym, Sony's win.But really, for most people, it's a toss-up.  I wouldn't recommend upgrading from the XM4, and the difference between the Sony and Bose will mostly come down to preference for comfort.  If you never find earbuds comfortable, get the Bose, be happy, and don't look back.  If you like the Sony sound signature and fit, and are due for a new pair, I do recommend the Sony WF-1000XM5.I'll update this when I figure out a way to mod the buds to be easier to remove from the case.  Probably  a little light sanding to the shell, or a few tiny dots of epoxy"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Good for a bluetooth headphone but not as good of sound as with quality wired in-ear headphones,"These earbuds work well once you have figured how to fit them. I had to go to some Azla aftermarket caps to get a good seal and decent sound. The wireless freedom is nice and they are comfortable. I have a pair of Etymotic ER4s and their clarity and power efficiency and sound isolation is far better, but having in ear earphones and being wired is not for everyone."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Great sounding earbuds that will stay in your ears,Likes:Excellent sound overallGood noise cancellationThey stay in ears even during light exersizeDurable - mine have been dropped twice but still work well.Dislikes:(Biggest gripe) Fiddly charging contacts - even after cleaning - need to ensure they are well seated in their case to ensure the earbuds themselves are chargingBattery life could be a bit better.Overall happy with this purchase.  If they could come up with a design that gives more confidence that the earbuds are actually making contact with the charging nodes this would be 5 stars.  Would probably purchase again.
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Good size, doesn't block noise with stock tips","My favorite ear buds were the Jabra Elite 75t, but unfortunately the volume in the right bud got too soft and they stopped making them, so I replaced them with the Jabra 7 pros.  The Jabra 7 pros sounded better, but the case was too bulky, the microphones were useless (no one could understand me on phone calls), and they were super glitchy.  Several times it became impossible to use both earbuds at once and I had to reset them, or one of the buds just didn't charge in the case.  I got Elevoc Clear buds just so I could make phone calls, but having two pairs of earbuds was not practical.  I thought of getting the Bose QC 2, but the battery life of 6 hours was just not enough for me.  So when these Sony WF1000xm5 came out with an 8 hour ANC battery life, I thought they might be right for me...The good:  The charging case is tiny, reminiscent of the Jabra 75ts--maybe even smaller.  There's multipoint and all the features you could want.  I had no trouble pairing them with my Pixel 7 pro and my linux laptop.  I've tested on phone calls and people have no problem understanding me.  So I don't know know if the mics are as good as the Elevoc clear, but at least these are good enough for phone calls (unlike the Jabra 7 pros).  Unlike what is claimed in other reviews, there is a small little spike on top of the left earbud, so you can easily tell the left and right apart even in the dark.The bad:  The noise cancellation did not work at all, because the ear tips don't seal in my ears.  Fortunately, the Sony android app will let you test for this, but I tested all four tip sizes and couldn't get any of them to seal.  Eventually what I did was take the tips off my Jabra 7 pros and put them on the Sony WF1000XM5s, and that got a seal.  That's not a great solution because I still might want to use my Jabras as backup.  (Moreover, the Sony ear tips have an ear wax filter, whereas the Jabras don't, so I'm worried this could be a long-term problem.)  I ordered the both the AZLA Crystal and the AZLA XELASTIC tips, and found that the large XELASTIC tips worked well for me, but not the Crystal (even though Crystal is a newer supposedly better product).  So now I have good headphones, but incurred an additional expense and shipping delay for tips on top of already expensive ear buds.Some more minor criticisms:  The buds are a little hard to get out of the case because they are so smooth.  The controls aren't quite as flexible as on the Jabra--there are just two configurations possible for each ear bud, as opposed to being able to attach any function you want to any action (single, double, triple press, etc.).  I experienced one minor glitch, where the passthrough did not work on the left ear bud, even though I could switch between ANC and passthrough by tapping that ear bud; the problem was fixed when I put the ear buds in the case and removed them again.Overall, despite the issues, I'm excited to have a tiny pair of ear buds again that are good for both listening to media and making phone calls.  I just think that for the price, this should be a product that just works out of the box and doesn't require after-market tips.  Maybe my ears are weird, but I've never had a fit problem with either of the Jabra buds I owned, or the two pairs of wired Shure ear buds I had before that.  (I did find etymotic ear buds uncomfortable until I got custom molded tips.)"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,They Really Missed An Important Mark,"Coming from owning so many various BT earbud, with the XM4 having been my favorite overall (albeit wound up dropping because of TERRIBLE longevity from short lived battery lifespan), I expected equal or better results from the XM5.While sound quality and overall performance were increased, these fell absolutely FLAT on their face in an area for me that cannot be overlooked. The handling of them is absolutely terrible! The size is so much smaller than the previous gen buds, which is nice, but the finish being slick and glossy around the spots where you grip them is a massive miss. Having big fingers makes them a total PITA to remove from the case first and foremost. The XM4 you simply grab and go, these I fumble with losing grip and the magnets sucking them back in. Just became a real headache to deal with. Not to mention getting them seated in the ears, as that slick surface made them more of a pain to tweak.Onto the sound. They do not fail to impress there. Sound is a tad but better than the previous gen offerings, even being so much smaller. That was nice to see. I did however, have more complaints from people while on calls vs the XM4. I also don't use the included eq as I have eqfy and that gives me greater overall control no matter what output device is attached, so I'd take that with a grain of salt. I don't think there are many out there that use standard settings much anyway, so sound is subjective.Pairing was fine, no issues at all with a single or 2 device connection between my computer, tablet or phone. They just bind and go.The other area that wound up forcing my return of them was that the left would drop connection while music was playing arbitrarily when I'd turn my head. Now granted they have the new  tweaks that have head position features, which I turned off, but for some reason that left one kept popping in and out of connection. Never in almost 2 years of owning the XM4 had this problem. I simply can't deal with that and they went back in the 30 days. Very unfortunate as I had high hopes.Ultimately, if you've got thin or small fingers and can handle them easier, they're probably a no-brainer choice for you. If you've got fatter or bigger fingers, you'll fight em every step of the way. Sony absolutely should have flipped the matte finish from the face to the handling areas and made the face the glossy part. Big fumble there. I guess I'll be looking into Sennheiser or B&W for my next buds."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Nice Sound, Mediocre Experience","In a sense, these are great earbuds because they manage the two most important tasks: they fit comfortably in my ears and they sound good (for earbuds).Unfortunately, everything else about them is a mess of questionable implementation decisions -- to the point that I felt compelled to review them.While they are comfortable, the design is _strange_ and requires a sort of twisting motion to ""lock in"" to the earlobe. From one angle, this is good: I do think this makes them fairly secure and helps prevent them from falling out. From a usability angle, though, they've got a weird shape which means they never fit into my ear the same way.This is a problem because the touch sensitive component is never where I expect it to be. This makes pausing or playing audio a trial-and-error affair as I search for the touch area.They're also small, though. So pulling them out means I will _always_ hit the touch area. I've found it to be almost impossible to remove the right bud without also starting my podcast playing again.Even that wouldn't be so bad except the in-ear detection is laughably bad. This negates multiple features like ""remove to pause"" and ""switch the other ear to transparency mode when an earbud is removed"". Those features just may as well not exist.Also, at random points, it will just tell me the current time and that I have no notifications.At other random points, it will just tell me that it's able to read notifications. Again, at random, based on no action that I've taken.Finally, I was expecting the noise canceling to be better. This could be because I'm using the smaller tips than I should be using: but that's required to avoid pain. And the seal is tight enough to cause me to feel like there's a pressure in my head, so I think this is a valid complaint.That said, they do work. And they sound nice. And the multipoint support works for non-Apple devices (which is the main reason I didn't get another pair of AirPods Pro).But on the software and design side, they just don't really live up to the other reviews I've seen. Which is really surprising since I _adore_ my WH-1000MX3 and WH-1000MX5 noise-canceling over-the-ear headphones. So I know Sony can do better. Maybe next time."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,Good sound but noise cancelation needs improvement,"This is my third pair of Sony WF earbuds.  I bought these WF-1000MX5 to replace a pair of WF-1000MX4 that were lost/stolen.  After using the MX5's for 6 months I can notice the sound quality and battery drainage has improved slightly over the previous generation.  However, the noise cancelling technology seems to be getting worse.  It seems to only work well with constant noise sources such as noisy fans or motors.  They do not work well with sudden loud noises such cars, impacts, dog barks, talking, etc..  I find that my older WF-1000MX3 had better noise cancelling than the MX4 or MX5.  Also, the MX5's always reset to ambient mode when you use them which a major source of frustration.  So you always need to open the Sony connect app or enable NC mode via a earbud button if assigned. It never did that with the older generation products. I've heard of similar complaints online about the MX5 noise cancelling mode.The MX3 earbuds suffered from battery issues and I am on my 2nd battery but the noise cancelling is much better than the MX5 earbuds in my opinion.  Perhaps subjective, but to me it seems Sony has dropped the ball on noise cancelling with it's newer products.  The new design and shape of the earbuds also makes them fiddely to get a good seal in your ear which also affects noise cancelling.  I am not impressed because I bought them thinking they would be improving this technology.  I have similar opinions about the newer Sony TVs.  Sony quality is definitely declining.  In summary this product is okay, but definitely not as great as the reviews hype them to be.  If you don't care about noise cancelling then they will suit you fine.Not sure I'll be wasting my money on Sony in the future though."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,I really wanted to like them,"PROS- Very tiny and pocketable case with a flat bottom (stands up on its own)- Lightweight and small earbuds- ""Bragging rights""CONS- Very slippery/glossy earbud sides- ANC on and off sounded 100% the same to me- Case felt cheap/fragile- Sony app is a disaster/often did not recognize earbuds even after connecting to Bluetooth- Battery life wasn't all thatI bought these buds to replace my aging Jabra 75t Active. They supposedly sounded amazing and had top tier ANC. They do sound slightly better, but ANC didn't work for me at all. I tried all ear tip sizes multiple times, tried jamming them into my ears to the point of hurting myself, and ANC did not work at all. I'd turn it on and off a bunch of times in a row and heard absolutely no difference whatsoever. I knew the right fit was very important for ANC to work and tried everything I could. So either I have alien ears or my earbuds were defective.The sides of the earbuds are glossy and very slippery. It's difficult getting them out of the case. I felt like I never really had a good grip on them and was deathly afraid of dropping my very expensive earbuds. The feeling is the same taking them out of my ears to put them in the case. Being constantly afraid of dropping them didn't work for me.The hinge and the top half of the case felt really thin and cheap. It felt like it could snap in half with just a little bit of force. Not a huge issue, though.The Sony app is a clusterduck of epic proportions. It's like they put the sales committee in charge of designing it. It's just awful in every way. Everything is hidden in an unnecessary menu and has a weird name/description. And having to create a Sony account to use certain features was the last straw.I expected much better battery life according to their specs. It'll probably last the full 8 hours, but don't count on it if you need them for something important towards the second half of your day. They did last longer than my aging 75t Active, but not by a substantial amount. I had ANC on at all times, trying to notice any difference between having it on of off. I never tested the battery life on these with ANC off.Other than Sony's app not recognizing the earbuds after connecting them to Bluetooth, I had zero issues with connectivity. They connected every time and I never experienced drops.I just didn't get enough benefits to justify the price of these earbuds. I then bought the Jabra Elite 8 Active and, although they're not ""high-end"" (no bragging rights), they're a huge upgrade to everything I care about. The ANC works very well and I barely have to place the earbuds in my ears. They're a lot easier to grip and feel secure in my hands and ears. The battery life is absurd. I charge my case once every 5 or 6 days (with ANC on 24/7). If I turned it off, I might not have to recharge them until next year.I've been eyeing Sony's earbuds since the XM3, but never felt they were worth the price vs. features. After the XM5 came out, I finally thought there was a chance they were good enough. Unfortunately, that didn't happen to me."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Excellent sound quality, minimal ANC, uncomfortable fit.","Update: I contacted Sony and they sent some extra ear tips made of silicone instead of the included foam. Part of the issue was that the air tightness test glitches, so I thought the foam tips were passing - there was no error message, it just didn't test. I was able to get the the airtight ear test to pass with these tips (the app still glitches and doesn't complete the test sometimes) and with airtight tips the ANC was detectible, though I expected more for the price. Even with silicon tips, I found the Earbuds uncomfortable after an hour and often had to push them back in when eating, moving, or talking. Hopefully the foam tips or complimentary silicone tips work better for others.***I really wanted to love these, but I am returning them because the ANC is negligible and they are uncomfortable for more than 30 minutes of use. I tried all of the generously included sizes of ear tips, adjusted ambient sound, noise cancelling, updated firmware, reset, etc. With noise cancellation on, there is the slightest difference in ambient noise, but I can still clearly hear everything from the air conditioner to the sounds of the gently tumbling laundry in a washing machine two rooms away. Nearby voices sound the virtually same on whether ambient sound is on, noice cancellation is on, or ANC is completely off. The biggest difference between ANC settings seems to be more about EQ changes when music is playing rather than cancellation of ambient sounds. The only way to avoid noise seems to be to turn the music volume up past the comfortable or healthy level - which also works on earbuds without ANC. I listened to multiple genres and loved the sound quality. However, half-way through each album my ears hurt where the buds pressed upon my ear both above and below the ear canal, regardless of the ear tip size I tried. I had to take breaks from using these earbuds. For the price I hoped the active noise cancellation would be effective and the fit would be comfortable for at least the duration of an album. Instead they have minimally detectible ANC and hurt after about 30 minutes of use."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Amazing noise cancelling,These earbuds are outstanding for anyone who wants or needs good noise cancelling. I use them for landscaping and they last all day going property to property. The sound quality is also really good considering the options at this price point. The connection stability does leave some to be desired though. Overall these are excellent for anyone who appreciates good sound quality with amazing noise cancelling.
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,I'm not an expert on buds but Im glad I bought them,"This is the most I ever thought I'd spend on earbuds. The only complaints I have is they're freakin expensive and I wish they would Bluetooth to multiple devices at once and they're not good for running with. They cut out a lot when/with bumps and jerks. Switching between my phone and laptop is annoying. Had only 3 months but they hold a charge awhile, charge quickly just in the case and also when plugged in. Has decent bass, my ears did hurt from wearing them after a couple days just like other people says it bothers them but I just realized writing this I haven't even noticed it since I first got them. I guess they took about 2 weeks of everyday use to ""break in"". Everyone seems to have a problem with the app and the 'tap' feature on the buds -I do not. I haven't used the speak assist so I can't speak for it. The mic works well on calls though. I make calls while riding a bicycle. I now use these for gaming too. I wear them to the gym- no problem with sweat. After buying them id be lost without them. Id say the sound quality is good idk if id say the best but for earbuds on this price range they're good. Not great for meditation music but great for hip hop and Rock. For the price it should come with it's own charge block. Can't compare to a different brand but happy with purchase. I'll update if have any problems.- I spent about a week deciding between these and the Bose so I know what it's like shelling $300 for freakin rare buds. Hope this helps."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,Sony has us fooled,"TL/DR: Sony makes sleek looking, clean sounding headphones with all the bells and whistles, and they've parlayed that into an image of ""the best"". They're not... Not by a long shot.I bought the XM4s because they had every feature you could imagine and all the reviews said they were the best, and I enjoyed them, despite the fact that they became extremely painful to wear after an hour or so. Bought the XM5s because they were supposed to be the same but lighter and smaller, but the pain still came, just after two hours instead of one.Sennheiser was my favorite brand before Sony and the Momentum 3 buds have 90% feature parity, so I ordered a pair to see if they were any more comfortable, and whether I'd even miss LDAC.My first impression was that the Senns felt more premium and the touch controls were easier to use. I loaded up the app and found that to be a much better experience, with far deeper customization options. I set the touch controls exactly how I wanted them - something I could never do with Sony's app - and sat playing with the sound personalization widget for the better part of an hour, marveling at how it was able to highlight the specific tone and details I enjoy most without muffling everything else like Sony's basic eq does. Then I started in on my test reel, and had to swap from Sony to Senn multiple times to make sure I wasn't hallucinating...Sony sound is clean, slightly warm, well balanced, with a surprisingly open soundstage. All in all it's better than average and generally inoffensive. ""Good enough"" for most people, myself included, or so I thought.Sennheiser sound is music injected directly into your brain. The highs soar, the bass thunders, and every drum beat is a Muay Thai whip kick to the cortex. The Sonys are simply laughable in back to back comparison testing.Even when listening to the few streaming services that support LDAC I can't tell any difference from APTx, and the Senn quality absolutely annihilates Sony regardless of source. After a while with the Senns I realized that there hadn't been a single cutout, something I had grown used to with the Sonys. Went running and immediately noticed the absence of the hollow thudding noise that accompanied every footfall while wearing the Sonys. The noise cancellation is close enough as makes no difference, and the ambient mode works well. All the automatic on/off, start/pause, etc stuff is there, and the Senns can connect to 3 devices at a time vs Sony's 2. Best of all: no pain, none. Where the Sonys are very comfortable at first and get increasingly uncomfortable over time, the Senns start off feeling slightly intrusive and then disappear from awareness entirely.Sound is very subjective so I can't promise that everyone will share my experience, but if you appreciate sound quality at all, you owe it to yourself to test them side by side. I honestly can't fathom how an professional reviewer could do so and not put the Senns on top by a wide margin. Having done so myself, I feel like I've been living in the Sony matrix for the last two years, and Sennheiser just unplugged me."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Outstanding quality and value,"This is another pair I bought to listen to YouTube videos and not disturb my wife. The other pair is for yard work (mowing, trimming, etc). Both are proving reliable, very comfortable, and providing excellent sound. Yes, they're pricey, but quality doesn't come cheap. I don't believe you can go wrong with these."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,XM5 vs XM4 vs AIRPODS PRO 2 -- WHY THE XM5s ARE GOING BACK,"Ever since they were released, and until recently, the Sony XM4 earbuds have been my favorite, ahead of my AirPods Pro 2 and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2. I say ""until recently,"" because the most recent firmware updates to the AirPods Pro 2 dethroned the XM4 at the top. In fact, if you haven't heard the Pro 2 running the latest firmware, you haven't really heard them at all. I've had the Pro 2 since release date, too, and while I felt they were an excellent update to the first gen Pro, the XM4s still bettered them in ANC and sound quality. Not any longer. The degree to which Apple improved both ANC and sound quality through firmware updates is not something I would have believed was possible. In fact, for a recent trip that involved a 9 hour nonstop flight each way, I left my Airpods Max headphones at home, only took my Pro 2 earbuds and didn't miss the Max one bit.SO... I was very anxious to hear what Sony accomplished with the XM5s, 2 years after the superb XM4s. And after spending the past week listening to them, I'll be sending them back. My issues:Fit: The only way I could get a ""good seal"" per the Sony app was by using the largest ear tips, which I found grew quickly uncomfortable in my ear. Even then, I had to twist the earbuds in deeply ""just so"" or the app would tell me to adjust them again. WAY too finicky to achieve what was ultimately an uncomfortable fit anyway. I don't have this issue with the XM4s or my Pro 2s. Plus, the Sony XM5 tips include an ear wax filter which I'm assuming is there for a reason, so I'd be hesitant to replace them with more comfortable tips that lack a filter.The Thud: As others have noted, the XM5s very audibly ""thud"" each time your foot hits the ground when jogging, running or even briskly walking.ANC & Sound Quality: Sony has definitely bettered the XM4 somewhat in both areas. Not dramatically, but still there. Measured testing I've seen shows that the XM5 better the Pro 2 a bit in cancelling lower frequency noise while the Pro 2 does better in the mid and upper frequency sound. I'd call it a draw. Similarly, while I prefer the sound signature of the Pro 2 running the latest firmware--it's a more open, natural and less processed sounding to my ear--others might prefer Sony's bassier sound. Since neither is objectively ""better"" than the other, I'd call this a draw, too. BUT... you've got the fit and thud issues with the Sony. If you can't get the fit of the XM5s to ""seal,"" and stay that way, both sound quality and ANC take a big hit. Plus the thuds are a constant annoyance that can overwhelm the sound quality.Bottom line: the AirPods Pro 2 remain at the top of the pack for me. And while the XM5s definitely improve on the ANC and sound quality of the XM4s, they introduce new issues which, for me, negate these improvements and leave the XM4s my preference in actual day-to-day use. For these reasons the XM5s are going back. BUT... if you like the XM5 sound signature, can live with the thudding and can manage to get a sealed fit easily whenever you put them in, you'll be happy with the XM5s."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,"Good sound, decent fit, tap to pause touchy","I bought these because of the pause on speaking and the tap to pause. These are important features for me as I am constantly listening to something and frequently have others who want to talk to me.The tap to pause is touchy, after two weeks with these ear buds, I have not mastered the correct tap pressure or spot.The pause on speaking is very good, perhaps too sensitive as it will pause when, for example, clearing your throat.Battery life when using noise cancelling is on the short side.Since these are the only ear buds I have bought with the tap to pause (others that I have had used the 'press a button' on the device) and pause on speaking, I do not know how they compare to others with similar features.Build quality seems to be good, the charge case is not as easy to place the ear buds in as others I have had."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,"Good overall, meh mic","I'm pleased. It has good sound quality,--I can hear new details in my music. They haven't  slipped out of my ears even when I go up and down stairs and feel quite secure. The battery life has been good--lasts around 2 days for me without issue. Good noise canceling--blocks out background chatter well and quiets subway noise decently. My only caveat is the mic. I've been told by multiple people that I sound far away."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Good Quality, Bad Design","It's a high-end Sony audio device, so you know the sound quality is at least very good. I'm not an audiophile, but I think these sound great. In addition, the noise-cancelling and hear-through are the best I've experienced.However, the case and buttons leave much to be desired. The smooth, rounded design of the earbuds make them VERY hard to remove from the case. In addition, the ""buttons"" on each pod are touch, not tactile, so even when you do remove the pods from the case, you will invariably press at least one button by mistake.The touch buttons are also sensitive enough that leaning your head against something will trigger them; don't even think about trying to use them in bed.Given the price, I find this unacceptable. My Jabra Elites are much better in regards to design and are indistinguishable in terms of sound quality.Perhaps If you have small hands or fine fingers, you won't have the same issues. However, I find these so cumbersome that I end up re-pairing other pods rather than trying to use these."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,"Good sound, mediocre design and software.","<Note- I worked in technology for a major division of Sony that didn’t include personal audio equipment> I’ve been using these for about a week.  NOTE- they sound flat and lacking in depth until properly broken in. After approximately 25 hours of listening, and changing out the crappy included ear tips for the boxed ones, the sound really warmed up a lot. I still can’t give the sound better than 4 stars as there are competitors in this price range that do a better job, but if you’re moving up from iPod Pros they you’ll be happy with the much better sound.Downsides- Design sucks. Why they used a curved outer edge can be chalked up to the cool looking factor. Sony wants their products to make you feel rich and powerful, to set you apart, so I get it. Not easy to get out of the case or ears, kinda hard to tell where the button is when in use, but Sony has always been form over function for many of their electronics.The software is crap- Another Sony hallmark. It’s usable but falls far behind literally every other headphone manufacture I’ve ever used. It’s not a big deal, but I’d expect more at this price point.That said, I’m still deciding weather to keep these or trade them in for a pair that I know are superior at the same price point (lost one of those buds in vacation so I thought I’d try the Sony’s)."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,New Favorates,"First, I just received these a day ago, so this is very limited first impressions.  I have used many different earbuds, most much cheaper. My first impressions are: Noise cancellation and Ambient Sound are the best I have ever used. I have never been impressed with Ambient Sound. Generally, I find it to be too much and annoying. However, these achieve a balance that is close to perfect. When in ambient sound mode I can hear the birds, cars and all the normal sound my ears would hear without ear buds in. Since I use these to walk the dog, being aware of cars and other sounds is very important. I listened to a Podcast and some music with these in this morning and found the sound quality excellent while in ambient sound mode. Since I have never been happy with the ambient sound mode on other earbuds, I made sure I could use one earbud at at time. In actual use I have found the single bud use to be seamless and a very good experience and can use right or left with no problem. The noise cancellation is excellent, if you have the correct in ear fit. I have only experimented with it a little, but the sound with listening to music while in sound isolation mode to be very full and rich. (Of course my 69 year old ears may not hear all the frequencies and tones younger ears might pick up on. While I have installed the app on my iPhone, I have not used it except for setup. At this point the app does not seem as if it provides much value, similar to all the other earbud apps I have used. Sometimes it seems like earbud manufacturers make an app because other earbuds do, but don't seem to be able to increase the listening value of the earbuds with the app. I do plan on exploring it and will update my impression if it changes. Having to bounce between the web site and the app to set the app up was more than a little annoying. That process should be much more seamless on a product of this caliber for a company that knows how to do electronics.Update: So far these are working great for me. The only downside is when you tap on the left earbud to go from ambient sound to noise canceling they only make a tone, so the only way to confirm what the status is, is to check the app. For example, when putting the left earbud in I may tap the earbud and unknown number of times, thereby switching mode any number of times. This can be confusing and I get confused which tone is for noise cancelling and which is for ambient sound. That said, these are still the best earbuds that I have used."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,Good earbuds but disappointing overall,"First off I'll say that these are good ear buds. If you don't have something comparable and just want the latest and greatest then these will be a fine purchase. With that said however, they are a disappointing ""upgrade"" to previous generation and even somewhat for other sony true wireless earbuds.I try out a lot of earbuds. So I have tried a ton of stuff on the market from basic low end stuff to Bose QCs and the Sony offerings. I've always been a fan of the sony line of truely wireless earbuds since the first time I tried them. The sound profile has always been much to my liking and I've always felt like the noise canceling worked pretty well.These XM5s however just miss the bar. The bass from these is terrible. There are better bass notes on the lower priced Link Buds S. That said, the sound is generally clearer and higher quality than the Link Buds S otherwise. In fact other than the bass these are definitely some of the clearest and high quality sounding ear buds I have ever tried.As for noise canceling, I really don't know what Sony did here but it's seems to be a step down from the XM4s. If I compare them back to back sitting in the same location with the same ambient noises and noise canceling on, I hear a lot more sounds getting through on the XM5s. I can hear the AC unit in my room with them on where as with the XM4s I cannot. I'm positive I'm using the best ear bud fitment for me (as I said before I buy and try out a lot of different earbuds, so I know how to chose the correct bud size). I don't know if it's just an inferior chip with them trying to reduce size and extend battery, or if it's just bad firmware that needs to be patched.As for the fit / weight, they are more comfortable than the XM4s. I've worn them now for multiple 3 - 4 hour sessions and never had any discomfort from them. They are noticeably lighter and smaller than the XM4s. I will mention the glossy exterior and smaller size does make them a tad tricky to get out of the case. Could also be the magnet holding them in is stronger, but I've slipped trying to pull them out a couple of times now.Battery life I would call on par for modern day ear buds. Nothing amazing, but definitely would consider it good. Even after a 4 hour session with ANC on the lower of the two earbuds was still at 33%. They claim 8 hours but that is only if you have ANC and everything off.Overall as I said, these are good ear buds, just disappointing that the ANC seems worse, and the bass tones are so bad."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Impressive, but lacking vital features.","The sound of these earbuds is pretty good, you can mess around with the EQ and find something you like. The noise cancelation is great, as well. The ambient sound mode is very impressive as well. They are comfortable to wear and you don't feel tired by them. However, I do feel like Sony has lots of work to do, still. For the kind of money, these earbuds are not very durable. I have run into issues with connection stability, touch controls won't work, an earbud won't turn on when taking them out of the case, and other issues. I actually reached out to Sony and they did replace my unit... only for the second one to start having similar issues again. Sony finally worked on the app, which was an utter disaster. It's much nicer now. But still, key features are missing. There is NO ""find"" function for the case or the earbuds, which is so ridiculous given that we are almost in 2025. Voice controls would make an awesome addition as well. Other, less capable brands have done it, and I don't see why Sony wouldn't be able to. When these things are fixed, these will be the greatest earbuds available."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Great headphones IF you know how to read,"My review is going to upset some, but unfortunately after reading a few of the negative ones I felt the need to write my own.Background: after going through THREE pairs of Apple AirPod Pro 2 I decided to pick these up, and I have used them heavily over the last 24 hours (~3 hours of yard work in 90F+ heat, ~1 hour in the gym doing weights, ~20 minutes cardio running outdoors).TL;DR: Overall these headphones do what they claim, provide awesome sound quality (note: not an audiophile, audio geek or whatever) compared to my previous Apple headphones, and the ANC is spot on. YOU MUST USE AND CONFIGURE THE HEADPHONE APP to get the full functionality and experience with these headphones. Furthermore, you need to actually CONFIGURE these headphones. If you don't, you are missing 80% of the features (ANC, transparent mode, geofencing), at which point I just order a cheaper pair.Pros:- Sound quality is spot on for the price range.- Personally, compared to the Airpods the fit is a lot better. I do wear foam earbuds a bit with my actual noise cancelling headphones, so I am used to them and prefer them over the silicone ones.- WHEN CONFIGURED CORRECTLY, the ANC and transparent mode blow away the Apple Airpods. Hands down.- The app has some pretty sweet functionality, such as an EQ tutorial which allows you to finetune the sound to what you prefer without understanding frequencies, adaptive mode (basically detects what you are doing, walking or standing still, and either turns on ANC or transparent mode OR however you configure it), and there the gesture thing, although I think is a bit gimmicky, can be cool for some.- The actual controls are configurable on the headphones as well within the app, and they work sell with Mechanix gloves on.- Unlike others, I had no connectivity issues. Phone was in my left pocket, and earbuds were in. I am 6 foot tall, ~225lb for an example of distance between headphones and device.Cons:- You require the app. You have multiple people on here claiming things like ""oh there is no ANC"" or ""oh boy I can't get transparent mode to work"". Yea, because if you read the damn insert that came with the package you would realize the app is required. I will say that there is a TON of functionality that is baked in, but it is somewhat cumbersome to figure out. I am fairly technical, and I even had to Google a thing or two to find the appropriate settings.- The case feels cheap. The Apple Airpods, love them or hate them, has a premium feel to the case, whereas these headphones are not exactly the best.- The adaptive mode is bit of a PITA to configure, especially if you are using these for the ANC to ensure you aren't blowing your ears out. For example, if I whistle it thought I was talking and then would shut the music off. It finally learned that it wasn't me actually talking but whistling, but still an annoyance. Furthermore, the adaptive mode will turn on transparent mode IF you are running/walking, and this occurred when I was using my mower. Not the most pleasant feeling."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Ear tip seal is key.  Sony will send you better tips for free!,"When I first received my WF-1000xm5 earbuds I was very disappointed.  If it wasn't for the Sound Connect app, I would have returned them.  The app has an audio test that evaluates how well the ear tips are sealed to your ear canal.  Most times I would fail the test but sometimes I passed.  If you have trouble getting a good seal, they refer you to a link where they will send more rounded ear tips for free!  Literally the next day I had them and found the perfect fit. (See pic)  The WF-1000xm5s are now my over all favorites for sound quality and noise cancelling."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,Sound is loud and clear,"For my aging ears, finally found earbuds with clear and loud sound.  Tried many other brands and models, and they all try to preserve listeners hearing by limiting volume, which would be not a bad thing for my ears too, 20 or 30 years ago.  But now I found what I was looking for.  They are also quite comfortable, and reach a little deeper in ear canals than others, which is what I needed.  Equalizer interface is not most intuitive, but allows for better adjustments than anything I tried. Don't be scared by claim of recycled materials, build quality is subjectively good, with the exception of lid very slightly loose, which is not noticeable under normal use."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,Amazing,"I have had 3 different brand /model of wireless, noise cancelation earbuds in the last 4 weeks. The first pair were Bose Quiet Comfort Earbuds 2. By far they had the best @ noise cancelation (I could hear nothing outside of the sweet music that they were creating.  The sound quality was as expected from Bose. The set up was easy and quick. However, at the end of the week I was ready to trash them (I sent them back) - they would not stay connected to either my iPhone 12 Pro Max or my MSI WS-75 Workstation. They were good for about 10 minutes, and then would have to reconnect.I then decided to try something different - Beyer Dynamics is a big name in studio monitor quality speakers, headphones and mics. They have a solution - the ""FreeByrds""."" Three drivers in each ear - unsurpassed sound and clarity...""  They did have good sound, they stayed connected, but the noise cancelation was non-existant (The reason that I wanted new NOIsE CANCELING earbuds for). I have a pair of 12 yr old Bose wired earbuds that block more sound than those were, and they aren't (weren't) catigorized as being noise blocking or canceling. The set up was long and complicated. Those should be back at the music store today.So I sprung for about $100 more and ordered a pair of Sony WF-1000XM5's. They stay connected. They sound really good (as good as the Bose? It's been a few weeks, too long to honestly compair...but these sound really good), they stay connected (actually you can connect to 2 sources at the same time if you want), and the noise cancellation is amazing, but I think not quite as good as the Bose (why I gave them 4 starts instead of 5). The set up was a bit more compilicated than the Bose were, and these fit inside your ear canal, where the Bose where more of an external fit.  I wish I would have gotten these first...oh, and battery life is great. With the Auto Abmient setting off, I am easily going to get 10 hours out of a single charge today - and that is sitting at my desk enjoying great music all day with no other sound to degrade what I am hearing...and the case is good for two full charges.Based on what I know after 4 or 5 days - I would buy these again."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Beware: used product sent as ""new""","The headphones are great, but -2 stars because the first pair I received were clearly heavily used.The first pair I ordered came in a completely sealed box that looked brand new. However, upon opening them, there were a lot of clues something was off. The case was shiny and lightly scuffed up. I thought maybe I was mistaken, so I paired them to my phone and started testing them out. Noise cancelling didn't seem to work at all, but I thought maybe the headphones were just worse than everyone said. I couldn't get the ear cups to fit. It appeared that I'd gotten two of the sized SS ear cups but no size medium. Then, when I was looking through the settings, I saw they were already registered to a different device.I requested a replacement and sure enough all of the problems went away and I love them.Amazon sold a re-packaged used headset as brand new, and not just one that had cosmetic issues one that wasn't functioning properly and was missing components. Someone had to go through all the work of putting a new seal on both the headphone case and the box itself, so it clearly wasn't a mistake.If you get a bad pair, return them and try again."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Decent, had I not already had the QC Earbuds II's","Purchased the QC II's about a week ago (& though happy), all the hype around the WF-1000XM5 piqued my curiosity. With the Bose, the noise cancellation has been (as expected) unparalleled, almost to the point of being downright dangerous (can't hear a thing when these things are on). In addition; without any tweaking, highs/mids & bass have been outstanding across the board with pretty much any genre in my eclectic playlist.Though I'm an Android user, I've been using (until they were recently stolen), the AirPods Pro (1st gen). Not the most comfortable nor best fitting (tendency for randomly popping out during a workout + having to frequently re-twist/screw them into your ear canal every so often) & obvious severe limitations with customization unless you're paired w/ another Apple product, but I had picked them up for a great price & they did their job. This being said, if anyone was unhappy with the fit/seal of the AirPods Pro, then the fit of WF-1000XM5 are going to drive you bonkers.The finish of the earbuds are a beautiful piano black, but removing from the case (which is a challenge) is also a bit confusing of ""how do I put this thing into my ear?"" I felt like I was trying to cram a rock or marble into my ear & even when it was positioned correctly, never felt as if they were secure (always felt & looked like they were on the verge of popping out). Yes, there is noise cancellation, but there was never a seal like the Bose (which may be a good thing for some), so you can still pick up ambient sound to some degree (vs being in a virtual sensory deprivation tank w/ the Bose). Bose, however, did an excellent job w/ the fit directed towards the ear, where the bud literally slides/pops/seals into place with nothing more than a slight nudge (as if it was custom designed for your ear) vs Sony's design, which felt as if actually fitting comfortably in an ear (or just ""fitting in an ear"") was an afterthought.Sound-wise, the highs/mids weren't as crisp as the Bose & the bass was nearly non-existent. I tested w/ the same playlist, with Rock, Rap, Hawaiian, 80's R&B, 90's, etc... & the Sony's (unlike the Bose, particularly w/ some nostalgic bangers from my H.S. days & earlier), did not make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.Outside of the less than stellar performance of the buds (as well as the extremely challenging fit), the design of the case itself (which is deceivingly smaller than the Bose) is also very slippery (a cover/skin, assuming available, is an absolute must), particularly with the buds themselves being nearly identical in size (the Sony's having a much larger overall mass vs the Bose / check out my side-by-side pics comparison). Again, smaller case, beautiful design/finish, but where it matters the most (fit/sound), these pale in comparison to the QC II's..."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,1,Complete garbage for the price ZERO stars,"TLDR: These are the worst sounding earbuds/headphones I've ever heard in my life. The application is trash, the touch feature is finicky and the noise cancelling is intermittent. I ended up buying the $60 Soundcore A40's and they are better in every single way.  Save your money, do not buy these Sony earbuds!!!!! I've never bought something so disappointing in all my life. I've never left such a negative review in all my life. This may all seem overly dramatic, but it's all the unvarnished truth, they are really that bad.I read the reviews, from what I can only now imagine were kickback scam review sites, and was super excited for these to arrive.These were my first wireless earbuds. I have some wireless headphones from Sennheiser that I love, but otherwise I use wired stuff for the most part. I am no audiophile, but my ears are fully functional so I can definitely tell the difference between headphone brands and models, I just don't really care about the differences.When I put these in and started a song, I laughed. I couldn't believe how trashy the sound was. In all my life I've never heard worse. Even $5 wired earbuds sound better (and the Soundcore A40's are miles ahead of these). After tweaking the EQ settings a bunch and trying my darndest to give these a fair shake, I was able to get them to a somewhat tolerable state, but wow they are still bad. I still have to chuckle writing this review how a product of this price could sound so awful.Speaking of messing with the EQ... I had to use their application, which I guess isn't uncommon with wireless earbuds. From the start it was a mess signing up, which it forces you to do (I am a 22 year professional computer tech veteran, the app was having all kinds of quirky issues).I kept getting repetitive prompts to set up voice command, which I didn't want to do and kept telling it no. It wouldn't let me pair multiple devices, so when I go in to the app and click on the text implying the capability, it pops up a window to tell me to go somewhere else in the app (which is poorly worded WHERE exactly) instead of just taking me there. Once I got it set up and had two devices paired, it requires you to USE THE APP to switch between them. My Sennheiser and my Soundcores both link to more than one device, and if one barges in audio wise, it pauses what you are doing on the other.The noise canceling seems to cut in and out, it's super obvious when the noise canceling is on as it makes an annoying sound, which I've not noticed from other noise canceling devices. If you turn off noise canceling, the sound quality gets even worse. I didn't think that as possible, but yet they managed.The touch capability is poorly executed. It does not register touches correctly. But I will say they have a nifty feature of pausing whatever you are listening to when you remove an earbud, which is nice.They are comfortable and the materials are nice.In the end I bought the Soundcore A40's and love everything about them. If you've stuck with this review this long, I can't stress enough how complete and utter trash these Sony earbuds are. I'm ashamed to share how much tech I buy from Amazon in a year and I've never been so disappointed with any tech purchase in my entire life. The saddest part is I didn't even spend my own money, so it's not like I'm bitter about a $300 purchase. Work paid for these, but even with free money this purchase made me mad over their audacity to release something so awful and put a $300 price tag on it."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,great earbuds,"sound quality and noise cancellation better than airpod pros. the only complaint i had is the tips of the earbuds are dense foam, i got silicone tips for them and it made the comfortably and noise cancellation way better."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,4,"Great sound system quality; however, the noise canceling is no different from the ambient sound","Great sound system quality; however, the noise canceling is no different from the ambient sound"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,Music great/ calls sucks,"I don’t like the fact on my phone calls anywhere I’m at the less. It’s really quiet. The calls are not good. I thought I was supposed to be crystal clear and everybody could hear you, but that’s not the case with these. I’ve already gone through one pair of earbuds Pair defective second pair. I don’t know what’s going on with them and one of the Sony people was rude as hell I was trying to figure out what’s wrong with my earbuds. I don’t know if he dropped the call on purpose because it was closing time for them or if the call just dropped, but I doubt the call just dropped , so yeah I don’t like that wasn’t helping me very well nor did he call me back after the fact the call was lost for Sony tech service so therefore I’m not very pleased with these earbuds because I’m in a noisy environment at work and I need them to work  Wise anywhere else they’re great for music but phone calls with this pair suck. My Sony fives, the big headset that goes over. My ears are so much better for music and phone calls problem with them. They’re not sweat proof that’s the  only qualms with my big headset compared to these earbuds. I love the fact that these earbuds are sweat proof and water resistant, but call feature sucks for some reason with this pair. And as much money as I am spending on these darn things, I’m not happy about it so I think I’m gonna try to get my money back or new pair because it hasn’t even been a year yet. I’m very disappointed in the call feature."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,5,"Yes, It worth an upgrade!","I was looking for the best noise canceling earbuds as I was tired of using a mediocre Galaxy Buds 2. So I started my research on earbuds that I can use for long hours and don't want to feel pain in my ears. Since I had Sony over-the-ear headset WH-1000XM4, I decided to go for Sony. I picked up XM4 earbuds from Amazon, connected with my Galaxy S23 Ultra and right away I was blown away by the crisp sound quality of XM4. I used it for a week, however, it was not comfortable at all. XM4 are bigger, heavier and the overall design is bulkier. So I returned those after getting pain in my ear canal and I completely dropped the idea of using in-ear buds. I bought Apple Airpod Pro 2 to counter the experience that I have just had with XM4 because it was cheaper than WF-1000XM5 and was highly rated. Though I am using Android flagship, but Apple Airpod Pro 2 can be configured using an ipad and macbook which I already have so I was able to configure it and use it with my Android phone. Other than spatial sound, I could use the Airpods pro 2 at their best. To my surprise, Airpods work amazing with Android espacially after I installed equilizers and increasing the bit rates. It even sounded better than when connected to an ipad. But within a week, I started to feel that it doesn't create an air tight seal to give the best music quality possible. I almost lost an Airpod without noticing that it fell out of my ear. Also while walking around, moving head too much, Airpods tend to get lose. I gave up on those also as it was not justified to pay premium price but not getting the features I need.So I went to the latest and greatest WF-1000XM5. These are smaller than XM4, lighter, made with premium material and you can tell right away that these earbuds are top notch. I connected my phone, enabled LDAP (Sony proprietary codec for bluetooth) and then up the bitrate in Android developers mode to maximum. Gave it some reverb and slightly increase the mids of XM5 and wow they sounded best of all that I have tried so far. It has memory foam tips, which are not that bad in the ear. I can wear those for hours without noticing that I have something in my ear. It creates a good air tight seal, ANC is amazing, sound quality is great. Some people have complained about ANC not be that good in crowded place, but in my use case I haven't encountered a situation where ANC is not up to mark. I personally think it was worth an upgrade from XM4 and it has given me better music on S23 Ultra than using Airpods. Sony knows how music sound great. These are earbuds until Sony makes the next upgrade XM6."
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,"Poor fit, I guess","I got these after reading good reviews and having connection problems with two different pairs of Bose QC ii earbuds. I had previously tried the xm4s, and they were good but too large for my ears and hurt after wearing them just 30-ish minutes. When I got these, I couldn't understand why the reviews had been so good. The ANC was just horrible. Definitely worse than the Bose and the XM4s. I've had them a couple of weeks and tried many different sets of ear tips and couldn't get any improvement. I mostly use earbuds at the gym, and with these, I could still clearly hear background noise and music, even over the sound of my own music. Sometimes the noise comes through so clearly that I can't believe the ANC is even turned on.Finally after two weeks using them, I tried pressing them further into my ears and holding them there. When I do that, the ANC is great, but they won't stay in that deeply unless I hold them, so I'll need to return them.  Apparently these are just not a good fit for my ears and I can't get a decent seal.Other:*The multi-point connection is great and works really well. It's ridiculous that the Bose doesn't have that.*Battery life is as advertised.*These are much smaller and more comfortable than the XM4s. The case size in a lot smaller and convenient.*Having to tap four times to adjust the volume is stupid and annoying.*No ""find my device"" feature. I got a case and attached a Tile. Another ridiculous feature omission.*The earbud volume is not synced to the phone volume, at least not on my Pixel 7. This means that if I use the phone buttons to change volume, it will only change up or down to the point that the earbud volume is set at. If you want max volume, for example, you would have to max the volume on your phone and max it on the earbuds. The Bose were not like this. Adjusting the volume on the earbuds brings up the volume control on the phone.I decided to buy a used pair of the original Bose earbuds. I'd previously owned them and sold them when I got the Bose II. They are big and ugly, and the case is too big, but they worked properly without any of the issues or frustrations I've experienced with the Bose II and Sony XM4/XM5. (But I will say that I probably would have kept these xm5s if they had fit well enough for good noise cancellation.)"
B0C33XXS56,Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds,3,UPDATE after owning for months:  NOT as good as the previous series 4.,"I have quite a few sets of earbuds, but I like the EQ that is available with the Sony series.They are a low output series, but for dialogue and movies, sometimes I like a bit more separation of dialogue, or with music a bit more bass. These are smaller than the 4s which is nice. They don’t have the warmth and larger sound of the 4s to me. I got them on sale during the Prime days sale, otherwise I wouldn’t have purchased them. The batteries wore out on the 4s. These will be fine, but I’ll also send in the 4s for a new battery, 🪫 Noise cancelling; they are semi-OK, but the iPhones Pro model is better. After owning the 5 series for a few months. They are meh, mediocre. I’d much rather have the older 4 series with batteries that can be easily changed. Again, the 4 series has a much warmer and fuller sound.I use the Apple pro series 2 for jet travel. I use a wireless adapter to the airline seats. The apple work best for that. Really cuts out jet (and crying baby) noise.The case on the 5 series. Real pain trying to find the correct position to put the ear buds in.Who the heck came up with this design 🙄"

ACCFR3Q77R6RRGAC,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bluetooth Headset,3,Decent product,I have used this with a non OnePlus device so take that into consideration when reading this. Just want to mention that if you are not an audiophile you will never notice the difference between AAC and aptx. These earphones only support AAC and SBC.Cons:The bass is very much lacking. The treble at higher volumes sometimes (although rarely) starts tearing up. If you are interested in movies with a lot of explosions and bullets flying around it won't be a very immersive experience. Pros:S...
ACCFR3Q77R6RRGAC,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bluetooth Headset,1,No BASS at all!! Not for music,"I'm fan for Oneplus since their first product. I have bought the series of products along their launch. Very first product from oneplus which did not meet my expectations is 'oneplus bullets wireless-z bluetooth headset'. It has no BASS effect at all!!! if you are buying for listening music and music lover, better to avoid. However, call quality, voice clarity  and battery backup are at its best. One of the best headset to consider for day to day usage."

ACCFR3Q77R6RRGAC,OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bluetooth Headset,1,Hated it!,"I have been using this product from couple months. This headset will absolutely not work for calls. The reason is, the build of Wireless Z will not get mic near our mouth. However, it works if you have absolute patience to hold the mic in front of your mouth for hours you talk or be in meetings.

ACCFKYE2ARGG67WC,realme Buds 2 Wired Headset,5,Best in the market!,I am happy good quality  product. Nice bass and sound clarity
ACCFKYE2ARGG67WC,realme Buds 2 Wired Headset,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
ACCFKYE2ARGG67WC,realme Buds 2 Wired Headset,5,Terrific purchase,It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.One more thing.... The cable organizer helps a lot while keeping the earphone safe and organized while travelling and keeping in jeans pocket.Hope realme buds 3 will co...
ACCFKYE2ARGG67WC,realme Buds 2 Wired Headset,3,Nice,Boat basshead 220 have better bass than buds2. But vocal of buds2 is better than boat 220...  It produces very clear sound 🔊 loved 😍 by music lover... Must buy but warranty must 1 year 😔
ACCFKYE2ARGG67WC,realme Buds 2 Wired Headset,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily. Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.v."
ACCFKYE2ARGG67WC,realme Buds 2 Wired Headset,5,Worth every penny,Sound quality is amazing and build quantity is also amazing my brother is also using this ear buds 1 for long time and its performance is still very good so I also ordered ear buds 2 and both are amazing and working up to expectations.
ACCFKYE2ARGG67WC,realme Buds 2 Wired Headset,5,Classy product,The Sound quality is superb and the base quality is also good ..The point thing which I liked in this earphone is that its durability ..the wire quality is good ..before I was using the sennheiser cx275 ..the wire got cut from middle ..I am happy with this earphones.

Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."

ACCFSDGXX3S6DVBG,BoAt Airdopes 131 Bluetooth Headset,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst product ever bought. Instead, you can go and try for ""Flipkart smartbuy bass beatz"". A very decent earphones in very reasonable price. Never go for boat airdopes 131 as this is just good in look and WORST in performance. Could have given 0 star if available in option."

It has pressable button towards the outer part by pressing which one can receive/reject call, play/pause music. The bass is not upto the mark. Call quality is nice. But what else you need for such low cost. Good for those who don't like in-ear silicone earphones."

ACCFSDGXX3S6DVBG,BoAt Airdopes 131 Bluetooth Headset,4,Delightful,Good for the priceSound if loud and clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is good. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.
ACCFSDGXX3S6DVBG,BoAt Airdopes 131 Bluetooth Headset,4,Good choice,Nice headsets. Great sound quality. Finest design.Will be better if bass also gets improved.overall nice and best @ this price range👌
ACCFSDGXX3S6DVBG,BoAt Airdopes 131 Bluetooth Headset,4,Value-for-money,"The earphone got delivered in 1 day. Speaking of sound quality the sound is good you get decent amount of base for the price. The design though is not upto the mark you cannot wear it for prolonged hours as it gets uncomfortable. The microphone is ok calling experience is ok not that great. Battery backups i cannot comment on that as I haven’t used it a lot. But for the price that you are paying ,this thing is totally worth the buy."
ACCFSDGXX3S6DVBG,BoAt Airdopes 131 Bluetooth Headset,3,Decent product,"I wish to point out one very basic thing the earbuds are designed well but the material used for covering the sound outlet is no good it in good brands its steel or metal based very fine mesh, in this case it  just came out to be nothing but a cloth based thin layer pasted with low quality glue. Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore."

One thing is that you cannot hold it for longer as the ear start paining. short duration is ok to use. I already owe One plus z buds , those are really very comfy. Haven't tested the backup but I believe it will pass that too.♥️The sound part is actually a bit heavy and not so c..."

ACCFSDGXX3S6DVBG,BoAt Airdopes 131 Bluetooth Headset,5,Simply awesome,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it. 3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look."
ACCFSDGXX3S6DVBG,BoAt Airdopes 131 Bluetooth Headset,5,Highly recommended,Excellent product under such a tight budget...Overall great experience till nowHowever the left earphone gets discharged earlier everytime than the right one even if I overcharge the left one separately or in pairGives a continuous playback of 3.5 hrs microphone is also awesome5 star for the product

Good wire quality.4. Mic is good and button is very useful for pause and play next song, also end call.5. Strap is useful. Cons1. Lack of 'L' shaped 3.5mm jack. 2. Position of buds are curved so always need to see which one is left or right."
ACCEVQZABYWJHRHF,BoAt BassHeads 100 Wired Headset,1,Waste of money!,After 6 month it won't work properly it's better to select other product than this even warranty is of no use they don't provide proper information it's better to select other than this even it's normal than other earphone
