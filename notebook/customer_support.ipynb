It’s fine, you’ll live.It’s beautiful, stylish but most of all you get all the features that mimics your phone. You’re not limited to the basics like you are with Fitbit.

That is where my displeasure with this device began. It is great if you don't mind having something on your wrist and can be a real assest to monitoring your progress. As of my last update in January 2022, Fitbit had not released a Versa 4 model. However, I can provide you with a general review of what a Fitbit Versa 4 might offer based on the features you've mentioned.The Fitbit Versa series is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking capabilities and smartwatch functionalities. Here's what you might expect from a Fitbit Versa 4:Fitness Tracking: Like its predecessors, the Fitbit Versa 4 would likely offer advanced fitness tracking features to help users monitor their activity levels, track workouts, and set fitness goals. This could include 24/7 heart rate monitoring, step tracking, distance traveled, calories burned, and more.Daily Readiness: The inclusion of daily readiness features would enable users to gauge their readiness for physical activity based on factors such as heart rate variability, sleep quality, and overall recovery. This can help users optimize their training routines and prevent overtraining.GPS: Built-in GPS would allow users to accurately track outdoor activities such as running, cycling, and hiking without the need to carry a smartphone. This feature enables users to map their routes, monitor pace and distance, and analyze performance metrics more effectively.Exercise Modes: With over 40 exercise modes, users would have access to a wide range of activity profiles tailored to different workouts and sports. Whether you're into running, swimming, yoga, or weightlifting, the Fitbit Versa 4 would likely offer dedicated tracking modes to suit your needs.Smartwatch Features: In addition to its fitness tracking capabilities, the Fitbit Versa 4 would function as a full-featured smartwatch, offering features such as notifications for calls, texts, and app alerts, music playback controls, contactless payments, customizable watch faces, and more.Battery Life: Fitbit Versa models typically offer multi-day battery life on a single charge, allowing users to wear their smartwatch continuously without frequent recharging.

I really got amazed by the price, since in my country it was $200 more than here. Regarding the sending, the product arrived on time. I don’t live in the US, and when it arrived to Ecuador, I could finally check it. Color and storage capacity were as requested. Cameras work perfectly, same as the buttons, speakers and microphone. Dynamic Island works fantastic, and I’m even surprised for the AppleCare warranty. What I got disappointed about was the battery level, as I requested for a “Reconditioned-excellent” phone. Besides, the selling ad did not mention I was buying an ESIM version, so I had to change my chip. Ah, and let’s not forget the little dent you can see on the side. I confess I was very doubtful about buying here due to the comments: some positive and some really bad. My suggestion, buy at your own risk, but not ensuring to have a great phone or not.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'B0CQ3VXJ3J', 'row': 74, 'product_title': 'Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 16-inch Laptop', 'rating': '4', 'summary': 'Excellent Build Quality, Very DIY Friendly For Easy Storage Capacity Upgrades, Not Price Competitive'}, page_content='review: The 2024 Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 14 inch has one of the most premium builds for a Windows Laptop in its class in my opinion. It\\'s very light-weight (2.7 lbs) and easy to throw in a backpack or carry in a suitcase. Aesthetically it looks very sleek, professional, and has ultraportable functionality. In terms of design & build quality, it\\'s a worthy Windows competitor to the Apple MacBook Air M2 & M3. I\\'m an on the go professional that works in the Construction, Engineering, & Architecture space and this is a laptop I’d feel comfortable using to conduct client presentations.I was able to attain the 1 TB SSD, 16 GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro, Core Ultra 7 Version (NP944XGK-KG1US) for $999 due to a pricing error on Amazon. For the price I attained it at - this was a great deal and that\\'s why it\\'s getting 4 stars from me. Currently, the same business version I bought is currently \"normally\" retailing for $1749 on Amazon & Samsung Directly. I needed this version as this is my work laptop as well. For that premium price, I believe there are significant cheaper alternatives available from PC competitors that offer way more bang for your buck for similar or even better specs.That being stated, I will start off my review with the positives:1) The 3K AMOLED screen on this laptop is gorgeous. Colors really pop & make for great video streaming.2) Really Easy DIY m.2 storage upgrades (I was able to upgrade storage from 1 TB to 8 TB) - Getting access to the motherboard to replace the OEM m.2 ssd and add my own took me literally less than 20 minutes with the help of YouTube tutorials + a Cheap $10 PC Tool Kit.3) 2 Thunderbolt 4 Ports, 1 HDMI 2.1 Port (that can run 8k), 1 USB-A Legacy Port, and 1 MicroSD slot.4) Fantastic Build Quality & Ultraportable - a true Windows Built Design rival to an Apple Designed Product.5) Some special integrated \"Samsung Only\" features if you\\'re especially invested in the Samsung Eco-System (w/ Galaxy Smart Phone, Quickshare, Smartthings, etc).6) Intel Unison Software allows call, text message, and image retrieval compatibility with iPhones & iPads.7) Keyboard comes with the new Microsoft Copilot Key integrated & a dedicated ai NPU chip.8) Intel ARC Graphics (much, much better than Intel XE Graphics of the past several years).9) Intel Evo Certified.10) Comes w/ Windows 11 Pro (on the NP944XGK version) – which is handy for integration with my company’s data servers & Microsoft Azure AD network.11) Battery Life runs at 8 hours (with full brightness and performance set to maximum with constant load with two m.2 ssd\\'s). I imagine many more hours if you reduce brightness, performance, and are running the stock OEM SSD.12) Fast Charging.Some of the negatives:1) While I got this for a great price, the normal consumer price of over $1749 is way too high for what you\\'re getting with this Laptop especially when benchmarked with other Windows PC competition.2) The 14 inch \" Pro\" version is capped to a maximum of Soldered 16 GB RAM in the US, Canada, and UK.3) The OEM SSD that the laptop comes installed with is not from Samsung, it\\'s an entry-level Western Digital m.2 SN740 NVMe 1 TB SSD which you can find new from IT suppliers for $50-70. The upcharge from 512 GB version to the 1 TB version of this laptop is $300 (Samsung is conducting Apple-Level price gouging but unlike Apple it’s not even using their own top tier in-house parts).4) Competitor Models from Lenovo and Asus offer similar or even better specs for $500-700 less e.g.  the 2024 Lenovo Slim 7i Gen 9 comes 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, Core Ultra 7, a similar poppy OLED screen, better battery life, and svelte durable light-weight design body, all of which can be attained for under $1000.5) The \"cheapest\" version of the 14-inch version laptop is $1449 and that only comes with a Core Ultra 5, 512 GB SSD, and 16 GB RAM which is a shame in 2024.6) Bezels of the screen aren\\'t terrible but they could\\'ve been smaller especially given premium pricing (e.g. Lenovo Thinkbook 13x Gen 4, Dell XPS 14).7) Same Design as Last Year\\'s 2023 Galaxy Book3 14 Pro.8) A small nitpick, but this laptop is only available in one color scheme in the US. It\\'s nice...but c\\'mon Samsung....Some Redemption:I will say that one of the most redeeming aspects of this laptop despite its negatives primarily associated with its pricing, is the fact that this has TWO m.2 NVMe slots (rare in a laptop of this size). I love that Samsung made it super easy and uncomplicated to get access to the motherboard. Theoretically, you could DIY upgrade this to having potentially 16 TB (yes TB!) of storage space in your laptop if you can run two m.2 8 TB drives. Might cost as much as the laptop itself, but it is indeed possible. I\\'m currently running two Samsung 990 Pro SSD\\'s with 4 TB each (8 TB total). Cloning the OEM drive was super easy with Samsung\\'s Magician Software.And ultimately, I must give kudos to Samsung on this feature - this has to be the standout feature on this laptop in my opinion and saves me from having to carry a portable SSD for extra data. If only they could\\'ve sold the 32 GB RAM version for the 14-inch Pro in America....Finally, for professional and business network/software reasons, I\\'m forced to be a Windows User and this is a good option for that. My only hesitation is that for its current market price, I think there are frankly better Windows options that offer more for less pricing wise (Lenovo Slim 7i Gen 9, Asus Zenbook UX3405) and the same pricing bracket for more (Dell XPS 14, Lenovo Thinkbook Gen13x Gen 4).If I paid the normal price, I’d be giving this review 3.5 stars.Alas I got a good deal, so whom am I to complain? :)'),\n",

This version got slight improvements on some stuff but no improvements on other parts.Comfort - the earbuds feel a bit smaller and got a better fit to my ears compared to the previous version. The ear tips got improvements as well, now they have a tiny net inside that prevents anything from reaching the inside of the earbuds. They still use the memory foam pad but I'm not sure if it is the same or not compared to xm4s.Sound Quality - I don't notice any different between xm5 vs xm4 . I use Tidal as my music streaming service. I have prioritize quality setting on the sony app and highest quality streaming on Tidal.The charging case is smaller and easier to carry around. The charging is fairly easy. Now the case have a pairing button instead of holding both earbuds for the last generation. Also for first time pairing, a pop up will show on the screen to set up and connect the device to the phone.Sony headphone app - the app is awful. They have upgraded to a newer version but it is still awful mainly for the updates. I always get notifications on my phone about the battery percentage of the earbuds. Updates have weird requirements and it takes long.Mic quality - I don't use the mic often but i used it a lot during a vacation to call my family/friends without having to hold my phone. I was told that my voice wasn't clear enough and was asked to repeat what i said multiple times. Two times i was told that the mic quality is bad.  I couldn't tell how bad it is, i can't call my self and find out. What I did is that I opened my camera app, selected video recording and chose the mic from the earbud instead of the phone. When I heard the recording, i lt was so flexible l horrible but I'm not sure if that was something wrong with the camera app or what.Connectivity - it is bluetooth. Easy to connect. For first time, open the case and a pop up will show. After that, just open the case and put on the earbuds and they will work. No loss in connection if it was already paired. There is one issue that was in the xm4 and still is in this one . I notice sometimes that when I return the earbuds to the case, they will still be connected to the phone. I had this issue on my previous phone with the same earbuds and never had them with different brands. Sometimes I notice it if I watch a video and no audio comes from my phone speaker but many times I return them to the case and do something else then find out later that they have been connected to my phone and never disconnected then I'd have to charge them again even though they were inside the case. I think sometimes they don't sit right inside the case which causes the issue I'm facing.I'd consider this one if I prefer convenience and comfort over sound/mic quality.\"),\n",

In fact, I ordered 2 of them so that when 1 pair died, I'd have another pair to use. Excessive, but effective. However, much like the XM4s, I think there are some quality control problems. By February, the first pair (XM5s) I ordered started acting up. It was having issues with voice calls where people would say they could not hear me at all no matter what I did, I went through all the troubleshooting steps with Sony and they told me to send the faulty pair to them. Which is okay, this stuff happens, but I also had problems with the XM4s that made me also go back to Sony support as well. the problems with my XM4s were that they would not charge and drained too quickly, as well as have problems where one of the buds would stop playing sound completely.So, I wanted to try the XM5s to see if all these issues were fixed. To be fair, they were fixed. The battery drain isn't quick, the sound quality is better, battery life overall and uneven draining is improved. They are a step up from the XM4s and I can confirm that. However, there are some issues with the XM5s currently. First of all, the call quality seems to be bugged out as my second pair has started to have issues just like the first. I’ve been using these comply tips and it could be the tips themselves but for whatever reason, there is a significant muting of sounds when the headphones are in vs when are out which didn’t seem to be the case before. It seems that these headphones have a problem with longevity and the quality control is pretty consistently not up to par with the price.It's a shame that in my review of headphones, it took this long to get to the sound quality of the headphones themselves. The EQ settings have been improved and you get some more curation based on your preferences. I think for BT, they sound great, Early into getting the pair, there were moments where it was so clear, I had to pop a bud out to make sure the sounds weren’t coming from somewhere else.The multipoint connections are still a little buggy.  I would have them connected to my phone and desktop and I’d get spammed by a message asking me to go back to my last used device. Only way to remedy this issue was to block that notification. For these reasons and issues, I just can’t recommend paying for these headphones unless they’re under a hefty discount. I don’t think you can justify the price while having all these glaring issues. The quality control and reliability of these headphones is extremely subpar and this has persisted through the XM4s and continues, unfortunately into the lifecycle of the XM5s.Update: mic issue has persisted and cannot get them to work anymore. I am constantly plagued by issues with the headphones that I favor the EAH-AZ80s over them as they are much more reliable. I do not recommend these headphones at all.\"),\n",

I have had it for few days now..- You can receive phone calls on the watch and have the option to answer or hang up.- You can receive text messages and read them. You can even reply with an emoticon that will pop up on the watch.- You can receive email notifications on your watch, archive them, clear them or open them.- In order to receive calls/texts/e-mails, you need to plug your watch (charge it) and go on your Fitbit App to activate this feature, after clicking on your picture.You also need to ensure in your phone settings, that you have notifications ON for your phone and you will be able to receive all those notifications on your watch.- In order to enjoy the functionality of your watch to its maximum potential, you need to invest time to explore its different features.  I find the e-mails I receive from Fitbit very useful to teach how to use. That is how I learnt. Or else, I wouldn\\'t be able to automatically receive the notifications.- GPS: I have not been able to use it yet, but plan on doing so soon. However, when you put Google Maps on your phone (Android), you should be able to receive the notifications (of turn right on X street, keep straight, turn left, etc...) on you watch. Which is cool.- Weather: you can have the weather at your fingertips! It showcases the weather in the area you are in automatically. If you tap on it, it will let you see a forecast of 2 hours at a time, as well as next 2 days! Isn\\'t it cool!?- Heart Rate (when active and when at rest!) Cool feature!- Steps/Miles/Calories/Exercise like any Fitbit- Clock: If you go on the app online, you can actually add up to 5 clock backgrounds! For Free if you click from Fitbit. Otherwise, there are some tier parties that either do for Free, or Charge a minimal fee.It is easy and fast to change and download!- Timers: there are 2 preset timers (5 and 10 minutes), or you can click on the 3 dots and select/customize your timer! When time is up, it will vibrate on your hand and give you the option to end it or repeat it.- Double Click: it gives you options- Press long on the left button: and you can program it on your Fitbit App, to lock to the feature of your liking! I chose the \"Find my phone\" feature, which is pretty loud and works well!I am sharing a detailed review because I wish I found one similar to explain all the features.If you like my review and find it useful, please click on the thumbs up.

From one angle, this is good: I do think this makes them fairly secure and helps prevent them from falling out. From a usability angle, though, they\\'ve got a weird shape which means they never fit into my ear the same way.This is a problem because the touch sensitive component is never where I expect it to be. This makes pausing or playing audio a trial-and-error affair as I search for the touch area.They\\'re also small, though. So pulling them out means I will _always_ hit the touch area. I\\'ve found it to be almost impossible to remove the right bud without also starting my podcast playing again.Even that wouldn\\'t be so bad except the in-ear detection is laughably bad. This negates multiple features like \"remove to pause\" and \"switch the other ear to transparency mode when an earbud is removed\". Those features just may as well not exist.Also, at random points, it will just tell me the current time and that I have no notifications.At other random points, it will just tell me that it\\'s able to read notifications. Again, at random, based on no action that I\\'ve taken.Finally, I was expecting the noise canceling to be better. This could be because I\\'m using the smaller tips than I should be using: but that\\'s required to avoid pain. And the seal is tight enough to cause me to feel like there\\'s a pressure in my head, so I think this is a valid complaint.That said, they do work. And they sound nice. And the multipoint support works for non-Apple devices (which is the main reason I didn\\'t get another pair of AirPods Pro).But on the software and design side, they just don\\'t really live up to the other reviews I\\'ve seen. Which is really surprising since I _adore_ my WH-1000MX3 and WH-1000MX5 noise-canceling over-the-ear headphones. So I know Sony can do better. Maybe next time.'),\n",

So I started my research on earbuds that I can use for long hours and don't want to feel pain in my ears. Since I had Sony over-the-ear headset WH-1000XM4, I decided to go for Sony. I picked up XM4 earbuds from Amazon, connected with my Galaxy S23 Ultra and right away I was blown away by the crisp sound quality of XM4. I used it for a week, however, it was not comfortable at all. XM4 are bigger, heavier and the overall design is bulkier. So I returned those after getting pain in my ear canal and I completely dropped the idea of using in-ear buds. I bought Apple Airpod Pro 2 to counter the experience that I have just had with XM4 because it was cheaper than WF-1000XM5 and was highly rated. Though I am using Android flagship, but Apple Airpod Pro 2 can be configured using an ipad and macbook which I already have so I was able to configure it and use it with my Android phone. Other than spatial sound, I could use the Airpods pro 2 at their best. To my surprise, Airpods work amazing with Android espacially after I installed equilizers and increasing the bit rates. It even sounded better than when connected to an ipad. But within a week, I started to feel that it doesn't create an air tight seal to give the best music quality possible. I almost lost an Airpod without noticing that it fell out of my ear. Also while walking around, moving head too much, Airpods tend to get lose. I gave up on those also as it was not justified to pay premium price but not getting the features I need.So I went to the latest and greatest WF-1000XM5. These are smaller than XM4, lighter, made with premium material and you can tell right away that these earbuds are top notch. I connected my phone, enabled LDAP (Sony proprietary codec for bluetooth) and then up the bitrate in Android developers mode to maximum. Gave it some reverb and slightly increase the mids of XM5 and wow they sounded best of all that I have tried so far. It has memory foam tips, which are not that bad in the ear. I can wear those for hours without noticing that I have something in my ear. It creates a good air tight seal, ANC is amazing, sound quality is great. Some people have complained about ANC not be that good in crowded place, but in my use case I haven't encountered a situation where ANC is not up to mark. I personally think it was worth an upgrade from XM4 and it has given me better music on S23 Ultra than using Airpods. Sony knows how music sound great. These are earbuds until Sony makes the next upgrade XM6.\"),\n",

It all depends on where I am (at home, on the go locally, or traveling) and what equipment I\\'m using (a Sony digital music player with a balanced headphone output jack or Bluetooth LDAC support, or a simple iPhone that only supports the Bluetooth AAC codec).My WF-1000XM5 pair arrived July 28, 2023 (the day before I wrote this review). After testing them and completing the initial update to the 2.0.1 firmware (by the time you read this, there may be a newer version), I found that I just left the earbuds in for the rest of the day, whether I was listening to music, making calls, or enjoying some quiet time. They\\'re smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than my WF-1000XM4 pair, to the point that I don\\'t really notice I\\'m wearing them.Sound-wise, there is a noticeable improvement in bass and in the midrange. I didn\\'t notice much of a difference in treble, although I like less bass and more treble than the average person (hence my choice of the IER-M9 over the two alternatives in that product line).The noise-canceling has improved across the board. As always, it\\'s important to try the different tips, including the possibility that you will need a different size in each ear. I was surprised to see that mentioned in the in-app tutorial!I am used to third-party expanding foam tips for my WF-1000XM4 pair, so we\\'ll see whether third-party vendors offer something similar for the new model. For now, the stock tips work fine. They remind me of the alternate-texture tips that come with the IER-M9.Now, a few flaws, worth mentioning given the price of this product...First, Sony\\'s model numbering is stupid and not consumer-friendly. Normal people can get excited about \"AirPods\" but not about \"WF-1000XM5s\".Second, the charging case, though now significantly smaller, still lacks any sort of finding feature. It would have been a simple matter for Sony to add the ability, through the clunky Headphones Connect app, to make a pair of earbuds in the case play a loud sound so you could find the case if you\\'d misplaced it. Apple of course makes precisely locating its products very easy.Third, in their hubris, product designers at Sony have made something small and lovely but forgotten about the environments in which it will be used. There is NO tactile feedback to let us distinguish the left earbud from the right. The L and R marks are tiny (just millimeters tall) and the use of dull grey for L and red for R makes them invisible in the dark. If I\\'m out walking in the evening without the case, have taken off the earbuds for a moment, and am putting them back on, I should not have to use my iPhone\\'s flash to tell left from right.Last but not least, the Headphones Connect app is becoming an ever more elaborate trainwreck. There are just too many options and features. With no distinction between what\\'s essential and what\\'s not, you have to open three tabs in succession, scroll down, and open endless settings panels (each accessed by a gear icon) to cover everything. Pesty notifications come back every time you start the app, even if you deleted them the last time. Sony tries again and again to make you sign up for various accounts, and is of course gathering information about you, your cell phone, and your listening activity every time you use their app. Since Sony\\'s 360 spatial audio only works with a handful of paid, proprietary music apps (a big gap, compared to the more-or-less universal, iOS-level support for this feature with Apple wireless headphones and earbuds), I don\\'t even bother setting it up.Overall, the WF-1000XM5 is an excellent pair of wireless earbuds in terms of sound, noise canceling, and comfort, and Sony could make improvements by renaming them, adding a raised plastic dot to make the right earbud distinguishable by touch, and ditching the Headphones Connect app in favor a lightweight (and ideally, data-privacy-conscious) control panel.'),\n",

The Jabra 7 pros sounded better, but the case was too bulky, the microphones were useless (no one could understand me on phone calls), and they were super glitchy.  Several times it became impossible to use both earbuds at once and I had to reset them, or one of the buds just didn't charge in the case.  I got Elevoc Clear buds just so I could make phone calls, but having two pairs of earbuds was not practical.  I thought of getting the Bose QC 2, but the battery life of 6 hours was just not enough for me.  So when these Sony WF1000xm5 came out with an 8 hour ANC battery life, I thought they might be right for me...The good:  The charging case is tiny, reminiscent of the Jabra 75ts--maybe even smaller.  There's multipoint and all the features you could want.  I had no trouble pairing them with my Pixel 7 pro and my linux laptop.  I've tested on phone calls and people have no problem understanding me.  So I don't know know if the mics are as good as the Elevoc clear, but at least these are good enough for phone calls (unlike the Jabra 7 pros).  Unlike what is claimed in other reviews, there is a small little spike on top of the left earbud, so you can easily tell the left and right apart even in the dark.The bad:  The noise cancellation did not work at all, because the ear tips don't seal in my ears.  Fortunately, the Sony android app will let you test for this, but I tested all four tip sizes and couldn't get any of them to seal.  Eventually what I did was take the tips off my Jabra 7 pros and put them on the Sony WF1000XM5s, and that got a seal.  That's not a great solution because I still might want to use my Jabras as backup.  (Moreover, the Sony ear tips have an ear wax filter, whereas the Jabras don't, so I'm worried this could be a long-term problem.)  I ordered the both the AZLA Crystal and the AZLA XELASTIC tips, and found that the large XELASTIC tips worked well for me, but not the Crystal (even though Crystal is a newer supposedly better product).  So now I have good headphones, but incurred an additional expense and shipping delay for tips on top of already expensive ear buds.Some more minor criticisms:  The buds are a little hard to get out of the case because they are so smooth.  The controls aren't quite as flexible as on the Jabra--there are just two configurations possible for each ear bud, as opposed to being able to attach any function you want to any action (single, double, triple press, etc.).  I experienced one minor glitch, where the passthrough did not work on the left ear bud, even though I could switch between ANC and passthrough by tapping that ear bud; the problem was fixed when I put the ear buds in the case and removed them again.Overall, despite the issues, I'm excited to have a tiny pair of ear buds again that are good for both listening to media and making phone calls.  I just think that for the price, this should be a product that just works out of the box and doesn't require after-market tips.  Maybe my ears are weird, but I've never had a fit problem with either of the Jabra buds I owned, or the two pairs of wired Shure ear buds I had before that.  (I did find etymotic ear buds uncomfortable until I got custom molded tips.)\"),\n",

It doesn’t always fail, but maybe 50% of the time or more, and appears to be getting worse lately.  The two screenshots are of the same loop run.  One shows a reasonable track, the other shows the issue I'm having with the watch, where the GPS tracking inaccurate and thus incorrectly reports distance and pace.I purchased this watch in December 2023 for my son who didn’t use it.  I started using it 6 or 7  months later when my Versa 3 died.I have 30+ years of experience debugging and resolving issues, a master’s degree in computer science and work as a director of engineering.  I’ve owned both Garmin and the prior Versa 3 GPS watches.I contacted fitbit support last November as I was fed up with the poor performance.  They were cheery and stated their commitment to resolving the issue.Support:  try loosening the watchband as far as possible.Me:  I don’t like a loose watch while running, but I’ll try it.  No luckSupport:  keep the watch away from your bonesMe:  The watch generally sits by the wrist bone, but since I’ve loosened it up, I’ll try sliding it up my forearm.  The problem persists.Support:  Factory reset the watch.Me:  I went through the tedious factory reset process and appeared to have success on the first following run.  But the problem reappeared on the next runSupport:  Your fitbit app is out of date, it’s 4.34.11 and needs to be 4.35Me:  I’m not having problems with the fitbit application, I’m having problems with the watch.  I went to update to 4.35 on my Android phone, but it wasn’t available.Support:  You need to wait for 4.35 to come out in order for us to continue this case.Me:  I waited for 4.35 to come out and resent the screen-shots of my failed runs.Support:  In the fitbit application go to exercises/run and make sure GPS is enabled.Me:  There are no exercise/run settings in the phone app, but there are on the Versa 4 watch.  I’ve sent them many screen-shots of the GPS tracked runs using the Versa 4.  Sent them a picture of GPS being enabled on the watch.Support:  Make sure the phone app has GPS always privileges and has privileges to run in the background.Me:  What does this have to do with the GPS on my watch?  Sent screenshots to show that GPS is always enabled on the phone app and it is permitted to run in the background.[I'm now waiting for another response, but they continue to throughout seemingly unrelated solutions to the fundamental issue]Note:  I’ve noticed now, with V4.35 of the fitbit application on my phone, that the Versa 4 will immediately report “GPS Connected” when I start a run, even if I’m in the house with both my phone and watch.  Neither can access the GPS satellites.  I suspect, with this version of the phone app, the watch is using the phone’s location services to indicate GPS connection, even if the phone is using Cell or WiFi to get approximate location.  The initial mile or so of my runs remains inaccurate, even though the watch starts off with “GPS connected”.Fitbit support does not seem to be focused on the source of my issue, the poor performance of the GPS system on this Versa 4 watch.  Is my watch faulty, or does the Versa 4 have a weak GPS system in it’s design?  I don’t know.This watch is not useful for tracking runs.  I would recommend anyone looking for a run-tracking watch look elsewhere.  The Versa 3 took a little time to get initial GPS lock, but then tracked without problems.  The Garmins locked quickly and were accurate.\"),\n",

I opened the camera and I thought I could just cut it on and you have to charge a battery and then add a battery AND the like memory card. And its not like you can just take a picture and then edit the exposure, brightness and so on. You have to like master the settings and read the manual before you can do anything.

They\\'re not... Not by a long shot.I bought the XM4s because they had every feature you could imagine and all the reviews said they were the best, and I enjoyed them, despite the fact that they became extremely painful to wear after an hour or so. Bought the XM5s because they were supposed to be the same but lighter and smaller, but the pain still came, just after two hours instead of one.Sennheiser was my favorite brand before Sony and the Momentum 3 buds have 90% feature parity, so I ordered a pair to see if they were any more comfortable, and whether I\\'d even miss LDAC.My first impression was that the Senns felt more premium and the touch controls were easier to use. I loaded up the app and found that to be a much better experience, with far deeper customization options. I set the touch controls exactly how I wanted them - something I could never do with Sony\\'s app - and sat playing with the sound personalization widget for the better part of an hour, marveling at how it was able to highlight the specific tone and details I enjoy most without muffling everything else like Sony\\'s basic eq does. Then I started in on my test reel, and had to swap from Sony to Senn multiple times to make sure I wasn\\'t hallucinating...Sony sound is clean, slightly warm, well balanced, with a surprisingly open soundstage. All in all it\\'s better than average and generally inoffensive. \"Good enough\" for most people, myself included, or so I thought.Sennheiser sound is music injected directly into your brain. The highs soar, the bass thunders, and every drum beat is a Muay Thai whip kick to the cortex. The Sonys are simply laughable in back to back comparison testing.Even when listening to the few streaming services that support LDAC I can\\'t tell any difference from APTx, and the Senn quality absolutely annihilates Sony regardless of source. After a while with the Senns I realized that there hadn\\'t been a single cutout, something I had grown used to with the Sonys. Went running and immediately noticed the absence of the hollow thudding noise that accompanied every footfall while wearing the Sonys. The noise cancellation is close enough as makes no difference, and the ambient mode works well. All the automatic on/off, start/pause, etc stuff is there, and the Senns can connect to 3 devices at a time vs Sony\\'s 2. Best of all: no pain, none. Where the Sonys are very comfortable at first and get increasingly uncomfortable over time, the Senns start off feeling slightly intrusive and then disappear from awareness entirely.Sound is very subjective so I can\\'t promise that everyone will share my experience, but if you appreciate sound quality at all, you owe it to yourself to test them side by side. I honestly can\\'t fathom how an professional reviewer could do so and not put the Senns on top by a wide margin. Having done so myself, I feel like I\\'ve been living in the Sony matrix for the last two years, and Sennheiser just unplugged me.'),\n",

YOU MUST USE AND CONFIGURE THE HEADPHONE APP to get the full functionality and experience with these headphones. Furthermore, you need to actually CONFIGURE these headphones. If you don\\'t, you are missing 80% of the features (ANC, transparent mode, geofencing), at which point I just order a cheaper pair.Pros:- Sound quality is spot on for the price range.- Personally, compared to the Airpods the fit is a lot better. I do wear foam earbuds a bit with my actual noise cancelling headphones, so I am used to them and prefer them over the silicone ones.- WHEN CONFIGURED CORRECTLY, the ANC and transparent mode blow away the Apple Airpods. Hands down.- The app has some pretty sweet functionality, such as an EQ tutorial which allows you to finetune the sound to what you prefer without understanding frequencies, adaptive mode (basically detects what you are doing, walking or standing still, and either turns on ANC or transparent mode OR however you configure it), and there the gesture thing, although I think is a bit gimmicky, can be cool for some.- The actual controls are configurable on the headphones as well within the app, and they work sell with Mechanix gloves on.- Unlike others, I had no connectivity issues. Phone was in my left pocket, and earbuds were in. I am 6 foot tall, ~225lb for an example of distance between headphones and device.Cons:- You require the app. You have multiple people on here claiming things like \"oh there is no ANC\" or \"oh boy I can\\'t get transparent mode to work\". Yea, because if you read the damn insert that came with the package you would realize the app is required. I will say that there is a TON of functionality that is baked in, but it is somewhat cumbersome to figure out. I am fairly technical, and I even had to Google a thing or two to find the appropriate settings.- The case feels cheap. The Apple Airpods, love them or hate them, has a premium feel to the case, whereas these headphones are not exactly the best.- The adaptive mode is bit of a PITA to configure, especially if you are using these for the ANC to ensure you aren\\'t blowing your ears out. For example, if I whistle it thought I was talking and then would shut the music off. It finally learned that it wasn\\'t me actually talking but whistling, but still an annoyance. Furthermore, the adaptive mode will turn on transparent mode IF you are running/walking, and this occurred when I was using my mower. Not the most pleasant feeling.'),\n",

The handling of them is absolutely terrible! The size is so much smaller than the previous gen buds, which is nice, but the finish being slick and glossy around the spots where you grip them is a massive miss. Having big fingers makes them a total PITA to remove from the case first and foremost. The XM4 you simply grab and go, these I fumble with losing grip and the magnets sucking them back in. Just became a real headache to deal with. Not to mention getting them seated in the ears, as that slick surface made them more of a pain to tweak.Onto the sound. They do not fail to impress there. Sound is a tad but better than the previous gen offerings, even being so much smaller. That was nice to see. I did however, have more complaints from people while on calls vs the XM4. I also don't use the included eq as I have eqfy and that gives me greater overall control no matter what output device is attached, so I'd take that with a grain of salt. I don't think there are many out there that use standard settings much anyway, so sound is subjective.Pairing was fine, no issues at all with a single or 2 device connection between my computer, tablet or phone. They just bind and go.The other area that wound up forcing my return of them was that the left would drop connection while music was playing arbitrarily when I'd turn my head. Now granted they have the new  tweaks that have head position features, which I turned off, but for some reason that left one kept popping in and out of connection. Never in almost 2 years of owning the XM4 had this problem. I simply can't deal with that and they went back in the 30 days. Very unfortunate as I had high hopes.Ultimately, if you've got thin or small fingers and can handle them easier, they're probably a no-brainer choice for you. If you've got fatter or bigger fingers, you'll fight em every step of the way. Sony absolutely should have flipped the matte finish from the face to the handling areas and made the face the glossy part. Big fumble there. I guess I'll be looking into Sennheiser or B&W for my next buds.\"),\n",

In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)Size-I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.Good luck, everyone!\"),\n",

I\\'m not a person that doesn\\'t ever charge my watch though. I always charge it when I shower. The charger is WAY better than Versa 2\\'s charging cradle. No more fiddling around with it, dreading the \"not enough power\" error. This sits right on top of the charger.APPS:-- There is no music support-- they have the \"find my phone\" app. Works like it should.-- THERE IS NO CALCULATOR APP! WHY!?!-- no 3rd party supported apps. Whatever you have already installed is what you get. You can\\'t get ANY other apps other than preinstalled. No notes app, no calculator, no memos, NOTHING. Hugely disappointing!!! Why would they do this?GOOGLE:--Google wallet is great and very easy to set up. You don\\'t have to have the google wallet app on your phone to set it up; it\\'s all through fitbit.NAVIGATION:Navigation works....but I don\\'t think I would use it when you\\'re driving. It\\'s just not as easy to glance at or give as much detail as your phone will. You can have both your watch and phone navigating at the same time. I thought it might vibrate when to indicate an upcoming turn or something but it doesn\\'t.DISPLAY:Crisp, clear display. Touch screen is very reactive, as is the button on the side. The watch is supposed to come on when you lift your arm, but this is very fidley and I find it only works half the time.CALLS:Calls are fantastic. You can hear clearly and be heard just as well. You can\\'t make calls, only accept them.CLOCKS:-- I was disappointed to find that my Fitbit Versa 2 clocks would not be compatible with Versa 4. Honestly, I\\'m not sure why Fitibit doesn\\'t have a fully customizable clock face, with custom settings and custom pictures. No, they leave that for other developers to figure out. I loved using Maxim clock faces, as everything could be customized (stats,colors,time, placements, and photo). No such luck here. There are a lot of options, and I did find one suitable for me. Should be offered by Fitbit themselves though. They have to know that most people want a personal picture on their device. If you are just looking for a cool background, there are tons to choose from.I found a photo clock that worked for me named Photo 2 by Wim Van Aerschot. There\\'s a free version and a Premium versionPROS:-- Slim, lightweight-- No trouble syncing-- Google wallet is 1000x better than fitbit pay, which only supports certain banks. None of my cards (sam\\'s club visa, capital one credit/debit) worked with fitbit pay. They work perfectly with google-- While you now have \"tiles\" that show your apps one by one as you swipe left or right (On versa 2 you swiped down and selected from a list) isn\\'t as user friendly, you CAN rearange the tiles how you please. And you can add shortcuts via long press of the button, if you want. You can also choose to hide tiles you don\\'t want.-- Calories burned seems very accurate. They reflect my suggested metabolic rateCONS:-- The style of the band is odd. The material is great, but for some reason they thought it would be wise to tuck the extra bit UNDER the band, not on top. It isn\\'t irritating like I thought it would, but it makes it a big pain to take off and put back on. The extra bit also means you might have to readjust size because the extra bit is tighter on your wrist. It leaves marks on your arm. Even most off brand bands still feature the \"under loop\" fastener, but you can buy silicone \"band keepers\" that slip right over the band, allowing you to fasten as normal.-- Lost Calories. For some reason, I have LOST calories, particularly after syncing or charging. I\\'ve lost 200-300 cal this way. Very irritating and it can make a huge difference if you are in a calorie deficit. I haven\\'t had it happened since, but worth noting.--It doesn\\'t show calories eaten on any of the tiles. Furthermore, the \"calories left\" on the \"today\\'s tile\" does NOT reflect calories eaten. Previously in the Versa 2, the Fitbit app would show how many calories you have left in that moment of time, whereas the watch would show how much you had left based on predicted calorie burn for the day. This watch only shows calories left to burn, based on your chosen \"calories burned\" goal.-- Stats don\\'t stack as they used to on Versa 2. You can rearrange them for sure, and that helps, but you otherwise have to keep swiping to see each stat separately. It seemed cleaner when they stacked on top of each other and you have to scroll down. Scrolling down from the clock face only shows settings, no quick select for google wallet (although you can set up shortcuts for long press on the button)You can get around this somewhat; for instance, I put the \"today\\'s tile\" on top of the list and the weather tile on the bottom. A swipe to the right brings up today\\'s tile quickly. A swipe to the left brings up the weather. Otherwise, you have to keep swiping to get different stats.-- while there is never trouble syncing, if you step away from your phone for too far or too long, you will have to resync. This was a problem with Versa before. I work in a fairly small, single story building and very few times can I actually respond to text messages without getting the error to resync. Fitbit desperately needs to increase the range of the bluetooth.-- you can\\'t \"write\" messages, like you can with Apple watches. You can respond either with voice (which does work well to be fair) or choose from a few quick responces from a list.FINAL THOUGHTS: I do love this watch, but keep in mind there are few improvements with many missing features. For a casual wearer, I think the update is well worth it. Downsides in customization, stats, and absent apps should be considered, however, and given that this watch has been out for a long while, it is unlikely to change. I\\'d say if your happy with your old Fitbit model, just keep it and skip on this.'),\n",

The phone reads it, and just sends data to the watch.  Phone has to be within about 20 feet of you.  A. When phone is out of your area..you will loose Bluetooth connection.  B.  If that happens, all I have had to do is open the fit it app on my phone and it starts syncing again .2. Download fitbit app to your phone.  Fitbit is owned by google, now.  You will need a gmail account.  They are free.-- the fitbit app is very clear, follow the menus and change your phone settings to ensure it works well!  The watch will auto connect if everything is set correctly.3. Download the Dexcom app onto your phone.  This software is very good, as well.  It walks you thru any setting s that need adjustment. You do not need Clarity, just the main Dexcom app!--you are successful when your phone starts reading you cgm!  Ps. You need your sensor and transmitter numbers!

My Jabra Elites are much better in regards to design and are indistinguishable in terms of sound quality.Perhaps If you have small hands or fine fingers, you won\\'t have the same issues.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'B0C33XXS56', 'row': 261, 'product_title': 'Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds', 'rating': '5', 'summary': 'Darn near perfection.'}, page_content='review: I have used pretty much every credible earbud in the last few years. Sony, Apple, Beats, Bose, B&W, Samsung, Klipsch, M&D, and more. I have also used every generation of Sony buds. In terms of overall use and features, these are not a giant change from the last gen XM4 buds. However, there are significant improvements in key areas. Here is the breakdown:Sound: There are moderate sound improvements here, over the last generation Sony\\'s, which were already close to class leading. Sony put a larger driver in here and it makes a difference. Additionally, Sony added a lot of processing horsepower here. The put in their latest chip for audio, but then added a separate chip to handle all of the ANC duties. Sony argues, that by separating the tasks here, they were able to more finely tune the audio. You can hear the difference. Bass is thumping, highs are even more crisp, and the mid vocals definitely pop more. I am no audiophile but these are really good. To me, these sound better than the latest Bose and Airpod Pro buds. You have to get into the really high-end audio companies to find sound this good. As always, you get Sony\\'s LDAC here if you can use it for high-end audio options and the DSEE Extreme tech that upscale regular more compressed audio. The DSEE really shines here. Your Spotify or Apple music app has never sounded so good. I think most folks will be very satisfied with what Sony has done here and, at the end of the day, sound quality is a big reason to make such an investment.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): These are the best ANC buds Sony has ever made which is saying something. They were already 1b to the latest from Bose, but these have improved dramatically to me. The new dedicated chip just gets it done. These buds adjust the ANC to the noise around you. I honestly hear pretty much nothing other than my music when I have these in. The latest Quiet Comfort\\'s from Bose are still at least as good to me in this arena, but that is pretty much the only area that Bose still is really on equal footing. At least in my opinion. Fit really determines great ANC, so while these are great, there is definitely some subjectivity that comes into play here. I think most will be very happy with the results they get here though.Form Factor: This is an area that Sony has absolutely nailed it and I am going to just say, FINALLY! Every bud Sony has made has always had an asterisk for me. \"They sound so good but they just aren\\'t that comfortable\" was what I often told folks. Not anymore. Sony has made these buds significantly smaller and by adding the glossy interior, has created a bud I hardly notice in my ear. They have gone from a \"yeah but\" to a class leader in the fit and comfort space. I really cannot emphasize enough how good these are. These buds have an IPX4 rating so they should handle the gym with no issues. Sony has included a revised version of their hybrid foam tips from last year and they are great. They just hold the buds in snug and really help block ambient sound. Just so so good Sony. Thank you for the thoughtful redesign. I also want to give Sony a nod for the case redesign. Same battery (3 charges) but much smaller. I love it.Battery and Connectivity: The battery life is the same from last year. About 7 to 8 hours of real use. It is fine. Not class leading but not bad either. Connection here is BT 5.3 so the latest. Same as last gen. However, Sony said that these buds will be LE compatible when they finally start rolling this out over the coming year so you can expect even better sound and perhaps even battery life someday soon. This essentially future proofs these buds.Call Quality: Not much to say here other than these are about as good as it gets. Sony added bone conductive tech here and you can tell. Your calls sound great.Intangibles: There are too many features to unpack here. You really need to read all that Sony has packed into these. From the upscaling audio, to one touch audio play, to speak to pause tech to gestures and so so so much more. You can literally get lost in the app. Almost too much is going on here. Regardless, there is almost nothing that these buds can\\'t do. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Sony has multipoint connection option here as well. It is only two devices, so there are more robust options out there, but this should be fine for most in real life application. Very good stuff.So, should you buy these? If you are an Android user, the answer is 100% yes. Apple users have to consider that Airpods are more tightly integrated into their space. Further, Apple is getting ready to launch their high end sound codec as well, which these will not support. They are still worth considering though as Sony has just made a better sounding product. To me, these might be the best all around buds I have ever tried. From sound to calls to comfort, Sony has just nailed all of it. There are companies that offer buds that do one thing better perhaps, but none are as complete as these in my opinion. So, yes, buy these. You will not regret it. I will update as I go here.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'B0C33XXS56', 'row': 276, 'product_title': 'Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds', 'rating': '4', 'summary': 'Comparison to XM4 and Bose QC2'}, page_content='review: I\\'ll keep it brief since others have reviewed more thoroughly.First thing, and I\\'m shocked to say this-- they actually are tricky to pull out of the case because of the shape and smoothness.  It\\'s unbelievable that a huge company can make a product so good in some ways and then just like, what, not actually try to use it before mass-production?  It\\'s genuinely worth removing a star for.  They could have put just a ring of textured area or a silicone band embedded; or just a little ribbing.  It would have been trivial, and should have been obvious from the first test.I think I read someone say they wanted a way to distinguish between left and right.  There is a small but obvious bump on the left bud, for this purpose.Bose are more comfortable-- there just is no comparison.  If you get a combination of tips and wings that fit your ear, it\\'s like you\\'ve got nothing at all in your ear.  It is THAT good.  The Sony XM4 was irritating by kind-of rubbing against the inner ear when fully inserted.  The XM5 have resolved that by being very slightly shorter.  They are comfortable if you are used to in-ear buds, especially well-sealing ones.  They will never be as comfortable as the Bose.XM5 sound quality is very similar to XM4.  I prefer the sound of the XM5 to Bose for almost anything.  The Quietcomfort 2 really emphasizes a kickdrum and then bass is muted.  It\\'s probably somewhat adjustable in the app EQ, but I didn\\'t try.  Percussion like shakers, cymbals, hats, etc all sound more realistic on the XM5 than the Bose-- the Bose makes them sound both synthesized/\"fake\" and undefined at the same time.  Mind you, the Sony is not audiophile grade-- if you have nice cans then you will definitely find the Sonys lacking.  But they\\'re great for what they are, and better than the Bose.Bose takes longer to turn on and connect (several seconds), but they take less time to get comfortably situated in the ear.Noise cancellation-- Bose are noticeably (10-15%) better at cancelling white noises (fans, air purifier, airplane).  So for a long-haul flight where that and comfort are most important, the Bose win.  Sony, however, did better at cancelling out sudden noises and voices, as well as background music.  So for the gym, Sony\\'s win.But really, for most people, it\\'s a toss-up.  I wouldn\\'t recommend upgrading from the XM4, and the difference between the Sony and Bose will mostly come down to preference for comfort.  If you never find earbuds comfortable, get the Bose, be happy, and don\\'t look back.  If you like the Sony sound signature and fit, and are due for a new pair, I do recommend the Sony WF-1000XM5.I\\'ll update this when I figure out a way to mod the buds to be easier to remove from the case.  Probably  a little light sanding to the shell, or a few tiny dots of epoxy'),\n",

I have used many different earbuds, most much cheaper. My first impressions are: Noise cancellation and Ambient Sound are the best I have ever used. I have never been impressed with Ambient Sound. Generally, I find it to be too much and annoying. However, these achieve a balance that is close to perfect. When in ambient sound mode I can hear the birds, cars and all the normal sound my ears would hear without ear buds in. Since I use these to walk the dog, being aware of cars and other sounds is very important. I listened to a Podcast and some music with these in this morning and found the sound quality excellent while in ambient sound mode. Since I have never been happy with the ambient sound mode on other earbuds, I made sure I could use one earbud at at time. In actual use I have found the single bud use to be seamless and a very good experience and can use right or left with no problem. The noise cancellation is excellent, if you have the correct in ear fit. I have only experimented with it a little, but the sound with listening to music while in sound isolation mode to be very full and rich. (Of course my 69 year old ears may not hear all the frequencies and tones younger ears might pick up on. While I have installed the app on my iPhone, I have not used it except for setup. At this point the app does not seem as if it provides much value, similar to all the other earbud apps I have used. Sometimes it seems like earbud manufacturers make an app because other earbuds do, but don't seem to be able to increase the listening value of the earbuds with the app. I do plan on exploring it and will update my impression if it changes. Having to bounce between the web site and the app to set the app up was more than a little annoying. That process should be much more seamless on a product of this caliber for a company that knows how to do electronics.Update: So far these are working great for me. The only downside is when you tap on the left earbud to go from ambient sound to noise canceling they only make a tone, so the only way to confirm what the status is, is to check the app. For example, when putting the left earbud in I may tap the earbud and unknown number of times, thereby switching mode any number of times. This can be confusing and I get confused which tone is for noise cancelling and which is for ambient sound. That said, these are still the best earbuds that I have used.\"),\n",

Part of the issue was that the air tightness test glitches, so I thought the foam tips were passing - there was no error message, it just didn't test. I was able to get the the airtight ear test to pass with these tips (the app still glitches and doesn't complete the test sometimes) and with airtight tips the ANC was detectible, though I expected more for the price. Even with silicon tips, I found the Earbuds uncomfortable after an hour and often had to push them back in when eating, moving, or talking. Hopefully the foam tips or complimentary silicone tips work better for others.***I really wanted to love these, but I am returning them because the ANC is negligible and they are uncomfortable for more than 30 minutes of use. I tried all of the generously included sizes of ear tips, adjusted ambient sound, noise cancelling, updated firmware, reset, etc. With noise cancellation on, there is the slightest difference in ambient noise, but I can still clearly hear everything from the air conditioner to the sounds of the gently tumbling laundry in a washing machine two rooms away. Nearby voices sound the virtually same on whether ambient sound is on, noice cancellation is on, or ANC is completely off. The biggest difference between ANC settings seems to be more about EQ changes when music is playing rather than cancellation of ambient sounds. The only way to avoid noise seems to be to turn the music volume up past the comfortable or healthy level - which also works on earbuds without ANC. I listened to multiple genres and loved the sound quality. However, half-way through each album my ears hurt where the buds pressed upon my ear both above and below the ear canal, regardless of the ear tip size I tried. I had to take breaks from using these earbuds. For the price I hoped the active noise cancellation would be effective and the fit would be comfortable for at least the duration of an album. Instead they have minimally detectible ANC and hurt after about 30 minutes of use.\"),\n",

It’s just tapping my wrist.I can also use the other functions that has such as answering the phone and answering texts. You can also check the weather and you can see the pictures that people sent you.There are really so many features to it that I’m not really sure that I would need the watch that has more features because this is really a good watch!I highly recommend this watch.

They supposedly sounded amazing and had top tier ANC. They do sound slightly better, but ANC didn\\'t work for me at all. I tried all ear tip sizes multiple times, tried jamming them into my ears to the point of hurting myself, and ANC did not work at all. I\\'d turn it on and off a bunch of times in a row and heard absolutely no difference whatsoever. I knew the right fit was very important for ANC to work and tried everything I could. So either I have alien ears or my earbuds were defective.The sides of the earbuds are glossy and very slippery. It\\'s difficult getting them out of the case. I felt like I never really had a good grip on them and was deathly afraid of dropping my very expensive earbuds. The feeling is the same taking them out of my ears to put them in the case. Being constantly afraid of dropping them didn\\'t work for me.The hinge and the top half of the case felt really thin and cheap. It felt like it could snap in half with just a little bit of force. Not a huge issue, though.The Sony app is a clusterduck of epic proportions. It\\'s like they put the sales committee in charge of designing it. It\\'s just awful in every way. Everything is hidden in an unnecessary menu and has a weird name/description. And having to create a Sony account to use certain features was the last straw.I expected much better battery life according to their specs. It\\'ll probably last the full 8 hours, but don\\'t count on it if you need them for something important towards the second half of your day. They did last longer than my aging 75t Active, but not by a substantial amount. I had ANC on at all times, trying to notice any difference between having it on of off. I never tested the battery life on these with ANC off.Other than Sony\\'s app not recognizing the earbuds after connecting them to Bluetooth, I had zero issues with connectivity. They connected every time and I never experienced drops.I just didn\\'t get enough benefits to justify the price of these earbuds. I then bought the Jabra Elite 8 Active and, although they\\'re not \"high-end\" (no bragging rights), they\\'re a huge upgrade to everything I care about. The ANC works very well and I barely have to place the earbuds in my ears. They\\'re a lot easier to grip and feel secure in my hands and ears. The battery life is absurd. I charge my case once every 5 or 6 days (with ANC on 24/7). If I turned it off, I might not have to recharge them until next year.I\\'ve been eyeing Sony\\'s earbuds since the XM3, but never felt they were worth the price vs. features. After the XM5 came out, I finally thought there was a chance they were good enough. Unfortunately, that didn\\'t happen to me.'),\n",

They were fabulous buds, but the battery life on them started to go way down. It was time to replace them. I decided to give the latest generation a try. Once again, Sony has hit it out of the park with the XM5s. The sound quality and noise cancellation are incredible. The new buds are physically smaller and lighter than the previous ones. The case is slimmed down a bit. The magnets that hold the buds in the case are not as strong, making it easier to get them out. The battery life on these new ones is fantastic!Some of the cons: The bass is a bit more punchy than the old ones, but that's not a huge deal. I just went into my music player app and reduced the bass a little. The buds themselves are very smooth, and can slip out of the fingers pretty easily. Would be nice to have a rubberized coating for more traction. In the Sound Connect app, it would be nice to be able to select a default option for Ambient Sound Control when wearing just one bud.Conclusion: If you have a pair of XM4s that still work, you would do fine to stick with them for the time being. But when they do die, get yourself a pair of XM5s. You'll be pleased!\"),\n",

Wonderful fit. Never a problem with air tightness. Sony is still sending me some alternate earbud tips for free. I have no idea how they'll work but I'm getting them mid-month.  Sony's sound quality is spoiling the p30i's for me but I'm still keeping them as a backup._____________________I had a pair of XM4s that crapped out on the left earbud after eight months. Was able to return them and get a refund. I replaced them with Anker Soundcore p30i's as a stopgap until Prime Day. I really like them for the most part. And for the price the sound is great. But I can't help remembering the sound of the XM4, although I wasn't sure if I was like building it up in my mind to an unrealistic degree. I wasn't.I just bought these on Prime day. I was really happy with the p30is and I still am. But the sound of the XM5s are so good, compared to the great at the price sound of the p30i's. XM5 sound is immersive, clear, round, rich, and beautiful whether I'm listening to opera, EDM, or K-pop. No flatness or separation between me and the sound. It's just so good in my head.Fit-wise the Sony earbuds are really hard to get airtight and I tried a couple of tip sizes. I recall with the XM4 I had to wait for the tips to warm up in my ears before they became airtight.  I have some replacement silicone ear tips, nothing special. Just some cheapies I had bought for the p30i but they didn't fit. These work better with the XM5 with the air tightness. Not quite sure whether the sound is as good as with the OEMs, so I'll have to compare.I'm going to keep the p30i as my second pair. You just can't go wrong at the price and the quality (and the battery life). They were a replacement for the Soundcore p40i which just didn't fit my ears at all and would fall out regardless of the size of ear tips I used.  But I have a feeling that the longer I keep listening with these XM-5s I'm going to have to get used to accepting or tolerating a not as great sound the the p30i delivers .For the price, the p30i are really good. Is the XM5 worth like $170-ish more? Yeah, I think so. My ears are so happy with this sound.Fit-wise the p30i don't fit any better than the XM5 But so far they haven't fallen out like the p40i did. Soundcore earbuds have tails and I'm really not used to them. And they tend to stick out of my ears a little bit more. The angle at which I have to put the earbuds in is a little weird for me. But it's acceptable and as I said, for the price, the sound is really great. Just not as great as the XM5.ANC- meh on the Soundcores (although they have good sound isolation); better on Sony.Controls- definitely better on Sony. Every time I touched the  the Soundcores to adjust them in my ears (which I had to do a lot with the p40i), it would change something in the settings.Battery life- p40i long battery life was one of the key reasons why I bought them. The p30i isn't bad either, just not quite as long as the p40i, But I've been getting three or four charges out of the case before hitting 20% on the buds and have to charge the case again. I don't know how long the XM5 lasts. But I do remember what the XM4 battery life kept shortening. I was only getting about 3 or 4 hours after a while. So I will be looking at that.UPDATE: getting good battery life from the Sony's. I can use the charging case three times before I have to recharge the whole thing. And I can just recharge the case alone. Usually I can have these in my ears for like 6 hours before I get a low battery which happens at 20%.I'm subtracting a star for price and that sort of quirky fit.\"),\n",

NOTE- they sound flat and lacking in depth until properly broken in. After approximately 25 hours of listening, and changing out the crappy included ear tips for the boxed ones, the sound really warmed up a lot. I still can’t give the sound better than 4 stars as there are competitors in this price range that do a better job, but if you’re moving up from iPod Pros they you’ll be happy with the much better sound.Downsides- Design sucks. Why they used a curved outer edge can be chalked up to the cool looking factor. Sony wants their products to make you feel rich and powerful, to set you apart, so I get it. Not easy to get out of the case or ears, kinda hard to tell where the button is when in use, but Sony has always been form over function for many of their electronics.The software is crap- Another Sony hallmark. It’s usable but falls far behind literally every other headphone manufacture I’ve ever used. It’s not a big deal, but I’d expect more at this price point.That said, I’m still deciding weather to keep these or trade them in for a pair that I know are superior at the same price point (lost one of those buds in vacation so I thought I’d try the Sony’s).'),\n",

As a graduate student pursuing a master\\'s in computer science at the University of Florida and a research assistant at the Learn Dialogue Lab, I needed a smartwatch that could seamlessly integrate into my active lifestyle, help me stay on top of my health, and even assist in my research tasks. The Apple Watch SE has exceeded my expectations in all these aspects.One of the standout features for me is the fitness and sleep tracking capabilities. With my busy schedule, it\\'s crucial to keep tabs on my physical activity and sleep patterns. The Apple Watch SE does an excellent job of tracking my steps, calories burned, and even encourages me to move when I\\'ve been sitting for too long. The sleep tracking feature has been a revelation, providing insights into the quality of my sleep and helping me make adjustments for better rest.Being a tech enthusiast and someone deeply involved in the IT sector, I appreciate the crash detection and heart rate monitoring functions. Safety is paramount, and the watch\\'s ability to detect a potential fall and initiate an emergency call is a reassuring feature, especially when I\\'m out traveling or in the middle of a research project. The heart rate monitor keeps me informed about my cardiovascular health during workouts and daily activities.As someone who loves teaching and mentoring, the Apple Watch SE also helps me manage my busy schedule. The calendar notifications and reminders keep me on track for meetings with my mentees and colleagues at the lab, which is essential for our collaborative projects, such as \"Collaborative sports,\" \"Amby: Language model for middle schoolers,\" and \"Integrate AI.\"Moreover, the watch seamlessly integrates with my iPhone, allowing me to respond to messages, emails, and calls without taking out my phone, which is incredibly convenient during our frequent lab meetings and while I\\'m on the go.In conclusion, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) has become an indispensable part of my daily life. Its fitness and health-tracking features, coupled with its integration into my professional and academic activities, make it a must-have for anyone in the IT sector aiming to be a leader in future IT solutions. Whether I\\'m teaching React JS or exploring new states in the USA, this smartwatch has proven to be a reliable companion. Highly recommended!'),\n",

You can check if it had repairs done to it by going into Settings > General > About and if there is an option that shows “parts & services” then you know it was worked on and you can further see if the parts serviced are genuine when you click on it.

Could be better in some areas, especially for the price, but overall I'm happy with it.Pros:- Excellent build quality with no creaks anywhere, although there's a little bit of screen wobble- Gorgeous display that gets plenty bright for indoor use. Scrolling is very smooth thanks to the 120hz refresh rate and you get those deep blanks thanks to the panel being OLED- Light for a 16incher- Great CPU performance. Very snappy with minimal fan noise even under heavy load, although it can get kinda hot in the space above the keyboard after awhile. Can't comment on GPU performance since I don't play games, although I imagine a dedicated gaming laptop with a dedicated graphics card would be better if you're a hardcore gamer.- Samsung integrations. I have a bunch of other Samsung products like the Galaxy S24, Tab S8, and Buds2 Pro and I appreciate the integrations between the laptop and these other products. I probably won't be using most of them but they're still nice to have. The most convenient ones for me have been the Buds auto-switching, Samsung Notes, Quick Share, and Second Screen.- Fingerprint reader works greatCons:- Keyboard. It's not a bad keyboard, it's just meh. The key travel is pretty shallow. Also all the keys are off-center thanks to the number pad on the right which messes with my muscle memory. Will take some getting used to.- Battery Life. Haven't been able to get more than about 5 hours of screen on time even with light use (web browsing and streaming). Might just need to wait about a week for all the optimizations to take place, but I'm hoping it gets better.- Speakers. Not the worst speakers, just meh. Could be better for the price.

However, upon opening them, there were a lot of clues something was off. The case was shiny and lightly scuffed up. I thought maybe I was mistaken, so I paired them to my phone and started testing them out. Noise cancelling didn't seem to work at all, but I thought maybe the headphones were just worse than everyone said. I couldn't get the ear cups to fit. It appeared that I'd gotten two of the sized SS ear cups but no size medium. Then, when I was looking through the settings, I saw they were already registered to a different device.I requested a replacement and sure enough all of the problems went away and I love them.Amazon sold a re-packaged used headset as brand new, and not just one that had cosmetic issues one that wasn't functioning properly and was missing components. Someone had to go through all the work of putting a new seal on both the headphone case and the box itself, so it clearly wasn't a mistake.If you get a bad pair, return them and try again.\"),\n",

I say \"until recently,\" because the most recent firmware updates to the AirPods Pro 2 dethroned the XM4 at the top. In fact, if you haven\\'t heard the Pro 2 running the latest firmware, you haven\\'t really heard them at all. I\\'ve had the Pro 2 since release date, too, and while I felt they were an excellent update to the first gen Pro, the XM4s still bettered them in ANC and sound quality. Not any longer. The degree to which Apple improved both ANC and sound quality through firmware updates is not something I would have believed was possible. In fact, for a recent trip that involved a 9 hour nonstop flight each way, I left my Airpods Max headphones at home, only took my Pro 2 earbuds and didn\\'t miss the Max one bit.SO... I was very anxious to hear what Sony accomplished with the XM5s, 2 years after the superb XM4s. And after spending the past week listening to them, I\\'ll be sending them back. My issues:Fit: The only way I could get a \"good seal\" per the Sony app was by using the largest ear tips, which I found grew quickly uncomfortable in my ear. Even then, I had to twist the earbuds in deeply \"just so\" or the app would tell me to adjust them again. WAY too finicky to achieve what was ultimately an uncomfortable fit anyway. I don\\'t have this issue with the XM4s or my Pro 2s. Plus, the Sony XM5 tips include an ear wax filter which I\\'m assuming is there for a reason, so I\\'d be hesitant to replace them with more comfortable tips that lack a filter.The Thud: As others have noted, the XM5s very audibly \"thud\" each time your foot hits the ground when jogging, running or even briskly walking.ANC & Sound Quality: Sony has definitely bettered the XM4 somewhat in both areas. Not dramatically, but still there. Measured testing I\\'ve seen shows that the XM5 better the Pro 2 a bit in cancelling lower frequency noise while the Pro 2 does better in the mid and upper frequency sound. I\\'d call it a draw. Similarly, while I prefer the sound signature of the Pro 2 running the latest firmware--it\\'s a more open, natural and less processed sounding to my ear--others might prefer Sony\\'s bassier sound. Since neither is objectively \"better\" than the other, I\\'d call this a draw, too. BUT... you\\'ve got the fit and thud issues with the Sony. If you can\\'t get the fit of the XM5s to \"seal,\" and stay that way, both sound quality and ANC take a big hit. Plus the thuds are a constant annoyance that can overwhelm the sound quality.Bottom line: the AirPods Pro 2 remain at the top of the pack for me. And while the XM5s definitely improve on the ANC and sound quality of the XM4s, they introduce new issues which, for me, negate these improvements and leave the XM4s my preference in actual day-to-day use. For these reasons the XM5s are going back. BUT... if you like the XM5 sound signature, can live with the thudding and can manage to get a sealed fit easily whenever you put them in, you\\'ll be happy with the XM5s.'),\n",

It\\'s pretty easy to use. It comes with a lot of stuff that I probably won\\'t ever need, but they are nice to have anyway. I think it is a good value. The only thing that bothers me is that it depends so much on the battery being charged. There is no power cord to plug into a wall socket so that you can shoot table-top objects without the battery. You have to rely on the battery all the time. It can get tedious remembering \"Oh yeah, I need to charge the battery — AGAIN\". Down time.

If you don\\'t have something comparable and just want the latest and greatest then these will be a fine purchase. With that said however, they are a disappointing \"upgrade\" to previous generation and even somewhat for other sony true wireless earbuds.I try out a lot of earbuds. So I have tried a ton of stuff on the market from basic low end stuff to Bose QCs and the Sony offerings. I\\'ve always been a fan of the sony line of truely wireless earbuds since the first time I tried them. The sound profile has always been much to my liking and I\\'ve always felt like the noise canceling worked pretty well.These XM5s however just miss the bar. The bass from these is terrible. There are better bass notes on the lower priced Link Buds S. That said, the sound is generally clearer and higher quality than the Link Buds S otherwise. In fact other than the bass these are definitely some of the clearest and high quality sounding ear buds I have ever tried.As for noise canceling, I really don\\'t know what Sony did here but it\\'s seems to be a step down from the XM4s. If I compare them back to back sitting in the same location with the same ambient noises and noise canceling on, I hear a lot more sounds getting through on the XM5s. I can hear the AC unit in my room with them on where as with the XM4s I cannot. I\\'m positive I\\'m using the best ear bud fitment for me (as I said before I buy and try out a lot of different earbuds, so I know how to chose the correct bud size). I don\\'t know if it\\'s just an inferior chip with them trying to reduce size and extend battery, or if it\\'s just bad firmware that needs to be patched.As for the fit / weight, they are more comfortable than the XM4s. I\\'ve worn them now for multiple 3 - 4 hour sessions and never had any discomfort from them. They are noticeably lighter and smaller than the XM4s. I will mention the glossy exterior and smaller size does make them a tad tricky to get out of the case. Could also be the magnet holding them in is stronger, but I\\'ve slipped trying to pull them out a couple of times now.Battery life I would call on par for modern day ear buds. Nothing amazing, but definitely would consider it good. Even after a 4 hour session with ANC on the lower of the two earbuds was still at 33%. They claim 8 hours but that is only if you have ANC and everything off.Overall as I said, these are good ear buds, just disappointing that the ANC seems worse, and the bass tones are so bad.'),\n",

It’s really quiet. The calls are not good. I thought I was supposed to be crystal clear and everybody could hear you, but that’s not the case with these. I’ve already gone through one pair of earbuds Pair defective second pair. I don’t know what’s going on with them and one of the Sony people was rude as hell I was trying to figure out what’s wrong with my earbuds. I don’t know if he dropped the call on purpose because it was closing time for them or if the call just dropped, but I doubt the call just dropped , so yeah I don’t like that wasn’t helping me very well nor did he call me back after the fact the call was lost for Sony tech service so therefore I’m not very pleased with these earbuds because I’m in a noisy environment at work and I need them to work  Wise anywhere else they’re great for music but phone calls with this pair suck. My Sony fives, the big headset that goes over. My ears are so much better for music and phone calls problem with them. They’re not sweat proof that’s the  only qualms with my big headset compared to these earbuds. I love the fact that these earbuds are sweat proof and water resistant, but call feature sucks for some reason with this pair. And as much money as I am spending on these darn things, I’m not happy about it so I think I’m gonna try to get my money back or new pair because it hasn’t even been a year yet. I’m very disappointed in the call feature.'),\n",

I have both and the ANC is noticeably better on the Bose. All I care about is ANC and I couldn\\'t tell from reviews which one was actually going to be better. Bose is better.I mainly use them during lunch in different restaurants to block out people talking and whatever music the restaurant is playing. I don\\'t know why there\\'s mixed reviews about this. Having tried both, Bose is clearly better. I did tons of reading and research and it\\'s hard to get a clear answer for some reason. I don\\'t even have the Bose QuietComfort Ultra II, I have the original ones (although I read that Bose didn\\'t change the ANC between those models).There\\'s 2 minor downsides to the Bose ones compared to these:A) On the Bose ones, when you\\'re not playing any audio there is an extremely faint hum in the background. As soon as you play any audio it\\'s gone, but these Sony ones don\\'t have any hum when you\\'re not playing audio.B) With the Bose ones, if you have ANC on and you get in your car and shut the door, something about the air pressure change makes the Bose ones make an annoyingly loud popping sound. These Sony ones don\\'t do that.I tried every earbud attachment with the Sony, including the silicon ones they ship you for free when you complain the standard ones don\\'t work. I tried both in multiple environments. In every situation Bose blocks outside noise better.2) Connecting to a PCConnecting to your PC Bluetooth for the first time is so counterintuitive it\\'s absurd. You won\\'t be able to do it without looking up step by step instructions. Then once they are connected, they have all kinds of problems. Using one set of bluetooth earbuds and the battery died? Want to switch quickly to these Sony earbuds mid game or mid TV show? No. No quick switching at all. I usually have to restart my computer to get them to actually work. They\\'ll say \"connected\" but I won\\'t have any sound. Apparently Windows doesn\\'t support whatever codec Sony uses and you can buy an alternative driver/codec thing but that\\'s ridiculous. If you spend this kind of money on earbuds they should just seamlessly work with any modern bluetooth device.They work fine with my phone (Android) so if that\\'s all you\\'re using them for then you\\'ll be fine. There\\'s an app I downloaded to update the firmware on the earbuds but then I deleted it since the features seem pointless and I\\'m sure they datamine with it.3) The sound quality is obviously very good, but that\\'s to be expected. Between these and the Bose I don\\'t notice much a difference, music sounds great on both. I don\\'t use either for calls so I haven\\'t really tested the microphone.The charging case is nice and small. Very pocket size, I liked that, and I like that it has wireless charging (the Bose case does not charge wirelessly). The fit is good, I don\\'t notice them even after extended use. They come with 4 different sizes of earbuds that are all a kind of stiff foam.If you go in the app settings you can do a seal test where it runs some kind of test to determine if the fit and seal in your ear is good. If you get it to say the seal is not good (before running the test don\\'t press them firmly in your ears, just have them barely not falling out then do the test) then on the screen where it says the seal isn\\'t good there\\'s a link you can click that takes you to an order page where you can put in your address and they\\'ll ship you 4 more earbuds that are soft silicon instead of foam for free.Overall I\\'m not happy with them. For how pricey they are I shouldn\\'t have to deal with Bluetooth connection issues with a brand new Windows 11 laptop. At this price point I should get perfection, and at the very least they should be easy to use. I\\'ve spent way too long troubleshooting the connection issues with my computer.I highly recommend Bose QuietComfort Ultra instead of these, especially if you\\'re main reason for buying them is noise cancelling.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'B0C33XXS56', 'row': 266, 'product_title': 'Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds', 'rating': '2', 'summary': 'Shockingly bad user experience...'}, page_content='review: I\\'ve used many different brands of earbuds, and for the price, these are probably the worst I\\'ve used, to a degree I\\'m struggling to comprehend. Let\\'s get one thing out of the way: they sound good. It\\'s better than my AirPods Pro 2s. Everything else, and I mean everything else, is so much worse. Let\\'s start at the top.These things are so slippery that I struggle to get them out of the case without dropping them. And for me, the shape is hard to get into my ears. Also, the case feels cheap. They charge $300 for these?Setup is a chore. You are required to use the app to access any of its features. And boy, is it a piece of work. From opening the app to first listening to anything took just over an hour. AN HOUR! You must log into a Sony account to get most of the high-end features to work, which is nonsense. And lord help you if you had a Playstation account 15 years ago. I appreciate the trouble Sony has gone to for security, but I had to do a 10-part captcha from hell twice to get into the account. And the translation to English in the app is poor at best, making the whole experience a head-scratching mess. The device pairing process is easy, however.The noise canceling is about as good as my 70-dollar no-name Chinese buds. Seems better at high-pitched things than general background noise, which is a strange feat as the former is much harder to pull off. I struggle to hear dogs barking, but my AC is as clear as a bell. The ambient pass-through is barely acceptable, not even in the same league as the AirPod Pros. Your voice tends to be over-amplified and slightly delayed, making talking to and understanding others a mess. The feature that mutes whatever you are listening to and turns off ANC when you start talking is hit or miss. It works about half the time when I start talking. The other half kicks on when any noise is picked up. Very annoying.Now, the reason I purchased these is Multipoint Bluetooth. This feature lets devices connect to multiple devices simultaneously and quickly switch between them. It\\'s crucial for any work that has you bouncing between phone calls and working on a PC. Let me tell you, Sony\\'s implementation is worse than useless. Can I connect to two devices? Sure. Can I stay connected to two devices? Absolutely not. When they are connected, does it switch seamlessly between the two? Also, absolutely not. If one is already making a sound, the other device can\\'t be changed without silencing the first device. So, say you are listening to YouTube on your PC and get a call. To switch to the call, pause YouTube and anything else making sound, then answer the call. And about 50% of the time, it will switch. Otherwise, you have to change it manually. What is even the point? Even more fun is that the second device can\\'t be switched to after some time, between 5 minutes and who knows how long, without manually going into settings and reconnecting first. Then you get another 5 minutes to a couple of hours of flaky \"fast switching\".The battery life is an actual lie. They claim 8 hours, but with all features turned off except playback, I got closer to 6. With ANC on, I may have gotten 4-5 hours. Each bud\\'s battery seems to drain at different speeds as well. So, while one may have 10% left, the other is already dead.I would be less critical if these were $100 instead of $300. Crucially, though, even at $100, I would still return them. Other than sounding great, they are terrible to use. And for $100, I can get earbuds that sound just as good but aren\\'t so finicky.In closing, I\\'m surprised Sony released such a poor product. They\\'re so bad that it\\'s tarnished my view of the company.'),\n",

So far as far as I can tell, there is no such trickery. All of the items are packed in one big box as one item. Mine came in an additional outer amazon box. If that is surely the case there is absolutely no reason to buy this camera anywhere else, especially if you have Prime. I personally ordered it on Tuesday and it arrived on Thursday even though it was only guaranteed by Friday.As you might suspect everything except the camera kit itself (body, 1 lens, neckstrap, etc.) are not Canon brand. As shown in the picture the memory cards are transcend, and the rest is a blend between a few brands, mostly Vivitar and Xit Photo (the brand for the additional two lenses). I am not as qualified as I would like to be to comment on the quality of the two additional lenses, and so will update this review once I have a true photographer friend check them out.As for the camera itself, the big disappointment thus far has been the \"Wi-fi\" capability. We were upgrading from a Rebel T1, and the majority of the functions for this camera are the same and work great. If you bought this you were looking for an entry-level DSLR, and that is exactly what you get. The Wi-Fi function however is fairly horrendous. Yes, TECHNICALLY you can upload photos directly from the camera to a certain set of web services (including google drive which is my choice), but not without first installing software on your PC and/or phone and going through a complicated set up process. Once you have all that set up you quickly find there is no way to simply \"upload all\" photos from your camera, but you have to select and send them one by one. The only possible exception to this is the Canon service itself which I have no intention of using. I have not tried photos set up for HDR yet, but I am relatively sure it will have a hard time for that as it wasn\\'t even advertised.Everything else about this camera is great, and the wife loved unpacking all the accessories. So far every item I have tested has worked great (the two memory cards, the memory card reader, the lens cap saver thingy, tripod. So many little things in here she didn\\'t know she needed.

I bought this laptop with the intention of primarily studying and working on coding projects while being able to take advantage of the Samsung ecosystem. However, I've found that the computer randomly gets incredibly laggy when there are few to no programs running in background. I have tried restarting, checking for any driver updates, malware detection, and troubleshooting guidelines. It becomes unbearable when even my music on spotify starts freezing and lagging. Writing this review on this laptop itself was quite annoying as well (see the lag in attached video).I bought this laptop less than 3 weeks ago on Cyber Monday and the sheer number of bugs it has compared to my old 2018 Macbook Pro has made it a pretty regretful purchase for me. I normally do not write reviews but my negative experience in such a short amount of time has been very frustrating.Even with most of my devices being Samsung, I would not recommend this product for the ecosystem nor do I think it even contributes much to it.

Nice picture quality and easy for a novice to use.'}, page_content=\"review: This is the 3rd Canon Rebel I have owned.  I had one before the era of digital cameras and then I purchased my first digital version 12 years ago.  My 12 year old very outdated Canon Rebel was still taking good pictures but the lag time and some other issues had me looking to finally upgrade to a newer version.  After reading reviews, I decided to go with the T6 and the package deal offered here on Amazon.This camera is everything I expected it to be.  An upgraded and better version of my older one.  All of my Canon lens and my Canon Flash attachment can be interchanged.  I still haven't had a chance to figure out how the Wi-Fi features works but will get to that feature shortly.I am strictly a novice photographer. I really have no idea how to use any of the manual settings.  This camera helps a novice feel more like a pro.  The quality of the pictures is impressive.  I highly recommend this camera for anyone that enjoys photography but may feel a bit intimidated by some of the more complex and expensive SLR cameras.  This camera is easy enough for anyone to figure out.I also recommend this package.  Although I won't use everything that was included, the memory cards, the UV filters ,and the two screw on lens attachments make it worth purchasing the bundle.  As for the UV filter it's good to use just to protect your camera. Sometimes I remove itbefore taking a picture and then screw it back on when I am finished. It's a great extra layer of protection.\"),\n",

It was fairly easy to set up - just followed a couple of videos on Youtube for that and to get a better idea how to work everything. Only had it for about a week but in that short time, I've really enjoyed it. I love the bigger screen, I like having access to Alexa on my wrist, I like being able to check the weather, I like being able to choose which apps I want notifications from, I like that it has built-in GPS. And of course, it does all the usual fitness tracking. I don't really care about the heart rate tracker (also not sure how accurate) but it does have it.

The first pair were Bose Quiet Comfort Earbuds 2. By far they had the best @ noise cancelation (I could hear nothing outside of the sweet music that they were creating.  The sound quality was as expected from Bose. The set up was easy and quick. However, at the end of the week I was ready to trash them (I sent them back) - they would not stay connected to either my iPhone 12 Pro Max or my MSI WS-75 Workstation. They were good for about 10 minutes, and then would have to reconnect.I then decided to try something different - Beyer Dynamics is a big name in studio monitor quality speakers, headphones and mics. They have a solution - the \"FreeByrds\".\" Three drivers in each ear - unsurpassed sound and clarity...\"  They did have good sound, they stayed connected, but the noise cancelation was non-existant (The reason that I wanted new NOIsE CANCELING earbuds for). I have a pair of 12 yr old Bose wired earbuds that block more sound than those were, and they aren\\'t (weren\\'t) catigorized as being noise blocking or canceling. The set up was long and complicated. Those should be back at the music store today.So I sprung for about $100 more and ordered a pair of Sony WF-1000XM5\\'s. They stay connected. They sound really good (as good as the Bose? It\\'s been a few weeks, too long to honestly compair...but these sound really good), they stay connected (actually you can connect to 2 sources at the same time if you want), and the noise cancellation is amazing, but I think not quite as good as the Bose (why I gave them 4 starts instead of 5). The set up was a bit more compilicated than the Bose were, and these fit inside your ear canal, where the Bose where more of an external fit.  I wish I would have gotten these first...oh, and battery life is great. With the Auto Abmient setting off, I am easily going to get 10 hours out of a single charge today - and that is sitting at my desk enjoying great music all day with no other sound to degrade what I am hearing...and the case is good for two full charges.Based on what I know after 4 or 5 days - I would buy these again.'),\n",

I\\'ve been running with Bose QC (1st Gen) buds for a couple years now. Aside from running into a few minor hiccups I\\'ll attribute to age, I\\'ve been more the satisfied with them. However, they are rather bulky and I do a lot of physical labor for work. It was time for a change. After a couple months of searching, I decided to try out the Sony x5\\'s.Out of the box I was immediately impressed by the size. Everyone in my house has airpod pros, so smaller earbuds aren\\'t new, but these were pleasantly small. The case was also a welcome sight. My QC1\\'s aren\\'t only bulky, the case is probably 3 times larger. Knowing I won\\'t have to carry that around in my pocket anymore was already making me happy with the decision. I\\'m also liking the wireless charging. This was one of the things that kept me away from the Bose QC Ultras(if I\\'m spending almost $300, I shouldn\\'t have to spend another $70 for a feature that should be standard in 2024).Like I said, I was kind of rushed during setup, which may have had an effect on this next take. But setup was much more in depth than I was expecting. Having to switch between multiple apps and sign ons was slightly off putting. But there was never a clear explation of why I was doing this. Having google assistant is a cool feature. But I don\\'t use it. And there was no walk through for Alexa. Also the push to use 360 audio(which is incredible, but more on that in a minute) was also confusing. You would think for how many steps you go through to get these setup, a lot of which are optional features, there would be some sort of \"quick start\" guide. But you\\'re left to figure out the touch controls on your own. Speaking of, there doesn\\'t seem to be any way to alter these, other than the long press option which is really just a short cut and not a real \"device control \". By the time I was done I only had about 10 minutes to listen to some music and cycle different sound settings before putting the kids to bed. However, I can honestly tell you that my initial reaction was not love. I wasn\\'t displeased, but for the price, I\\'d hoped to be wowed.The next day I had some running around to do so I had more time to play around with them. I will say that while I wasn\\'t overly impressed at first, day 2 made me feel much better about these in a lot of ways. The sound is incredible. The EQ options let you do so much and really do make you feel like you\\'re in the music. The bass isn\\'t quite as strong as I\\'d hoped, but I could get used to that if I had to.However, and thus probably my biggest issue with these, the Noise Cancelation isn\\'t anywhere near as good as my old Bose buds. With those, I could pop the two in, fire up my gas powered backpack leaf blower and hardly hear a hum. With the sony\\'s, I had a hard time telling sometimes if noise cancelation was on or not. Granted, I did have the voice filtering turned on. But the idea is that it let\\'s voices through but not ambient noise. In reality, it seems like it let\\'s an awful lot of background noise in. I do like that i can switch ANC on and off with a simple touch of the left bud, but while using the mode that detects your current activity (running, sitting, driving etc) and adjusts automatically, I\\'ve found that it cuts over ANC mode on its own pretty frequently. These little features are great in theory, but they aren\\'t refined enough at this point to make them useful on a daily basis and serve more as a fluff feature rather than truly useful ones.I still haven\\'t tried out phone calls, which I plan to do tomorrow. But overall, when you consider the price and the competition I\\'m still not sold on these yet. They are no doubt a great product, fit wonderfully and sound superb. They are probably ideal and good enough for a lot of people. Just not quite convinced they are what I\\'m look for'),\n",

I guess they took about 2 weeks of everyday use to \"break in\". Everyone seems to have a problem with the app and the \\'tap\\' feature on the buds -I do not.

I wear them to the gym- no problem with sweat. After buying them id be lost without them. Id say the sound quality is good idk if id say the best but for earbuds on this price range they\\'re good. Not great for meditation music but great for hip hop and Rock. For the price it should come with it\\'s own charge block. Can\\'t compare to a different brand but happy with purchase.

Unfortunately,  I have watched their top of the line designs (TV's and headphones in particular) change from 'cost no object quality products' to designs that are purposely simplified and cheapened to save in manufacturing costs.  A good example is the change from the XM4 headphones to XM5 models with the later looking like a sub $100 pair of headphones with weak pivot points, poor folding size, large case, cheap plastic, and thin bass sound.  Those headphones at least improved the mids and highs...which I cannot say for these WF-1000XM5 earbuds.  It seems Sony finds some great wins, then removes those that work in the next revisions to be different and does not listen to their customers.  An example is the effective voice confirmations in mode changes that now are replaced with beeps and some modes being removed.  This is very helpful in flights, when there is a lot of ambient noise.These WF-1000XM5 earbuds epitomize this cheap concept in being  too slippery (what happened to the nice matt finish in XM4's), awkward to handle and insert, weird fitting in the case as they rock around not making contact, and exuding a boomy cheap sound.  The case seems like it was designed for a different product.  To be clear, I gave them plenty of time to break in and though they improved...they plateaued way too soon.  I understand cost savings are important, but these earphones are $300 and marketed as their best and these do not exude quality like their previous models and this is immediately obvious.  The gloss finish is very slippery, not ideal for handling and looks cheap.  The attractive bronze (rose gold?) accents from the past are all but gone.  They are moderately comfortable but leak sound making you constantly guess whether or not ambient sound is on or off.  Touch control seems more irregular and modes are removed.  Conversely, I have found my XM4's (I have 2 pairs) to sometimes cause mild pain in my ears over long use which I did not experience with these XM5's though the XM5 for me feel like they are falling out with their more rounded shape.The soundstage is muddy and closed in and does not outperform the XM4 earphones, in my opinion.  Some music with perfect recordings sounds OK, but across the board they fall short in getting the  best out of the music and I listen to many types of music.  Just like the WH-1000XM5 headphones (which I returned to keep XM4's), these are no better sounding than their predecessors and for me the sound quality is first and foremost.  Accuracy has always been Sony's forte but I have found that has changed.  I have high end audio equipment including tube amps, and a full home theater so admittingly I might be a little picky; however previous models from Sony have kept me content and not a single flight I take is without their headphones or earphones.The ANC and phone call quality are very good but as the foam does not seal well there is that sound leakage in my ears no matter which tips I tried or how I turned them...meaning many will have to buy aftermarkets right away to get that softer better conforming ear pad...which is not a requirement with many of their competitors.  I truly feel like Sony's design team did not spend enough time to cross the t's and dot the i's for these headphones and the budget was too low for a high quality design.  The battery life is worse than previous models and I tested them side by side with XM4 using the same settings and same volume.  They are smaller...for those who need to save space but I would prefer sound quality improvements over reduction in size.  They are also more efficient with less more volume from a lower setting on my S23 Ultra.I did the prepurchase for these earphones and use my others daily but unfortunately I returned them and will stick with the previous models as I try others...which is disappointing.  I was surprised about the many positive professional reviews and it does make me feel like they could be a little biased.\"),\n",

I had previously tried the xm4s, and they were good but too large for my ears and hurt after wearing them just 30-ish minutes. When I got these, I couldn\\'t understand why the reviews had been so good. The ANC was just horrible. Definitely worse than the Bose and the XM4s. I\\'ve had them a couple of weeks and tried many different sets of ear tips and couldn\\'t get any improvement. I mostly use earbuds at the gym, and with these, I could still clearly hear background noise and music, even over the sound of my own music. Sometimes the noise comes through so clearly that I can\\'t believe the ANC is even turned on.Finally after two weeks using them, I tried pressing them further into my ears and holding them there. When I do that, the ANC is great, but they won\\'t stay in that deeply unless I hold them, so I\\'ll need to return them. \\xa0Apparently these are just not a good fit for my ears and I can\\'t get a decent seal.Other:*The multi-point connection is great and works really well. It\\'s ridiculous that the Bose doesn\\'t have that.*Battery life is as advertised.*These are much smaller and more comfortable than the XM4s. The case size in a lot smaller and convenient.*Having to tap four times to adjust the volume is stupid and annoying.*No \"find my device\" feature. I got a case and attached a Tile. Another ridiculous feature omission.*The earbud volume is not synced to the phone volume, at least not on my Pixel 7. This means that if I use the phone buttons to change volume, it will only change up or down to the point that the earbud volume is set at. If you want max volume, for example, you would have to max the volume on your phone and max it on the earbuds. The Bose were not like this. Adjusting the volume on the earbuds brings up the volume control on the phone.I decided to buy a used pair of the original Bose earbuds. I\\'d previously owned them and sold them when I got the Bose II. They are big and ugly, and the case is too big, but they worked properly without any of the issues or frustrations I\\'ve experienced with the Bose II and Sony XM4/XM5. (But I will say that I probably would have kept these xm5s if they had fit well enough for good noise cancellation.)'),\n",

It kept asking for the BitLocker code after ever reboot.  Then every time you click Shutdown in Windows, it just rebooted so to shut down had to do a hard reboot.  I am in IT and spent hours troubleshooting all to no avail and sent it back.  Great product, but just a fair warning on the consistent quality and usage.Update, there are places on the Internet, including Samsung's site, that says Windows 11 Pro will work on this laptop - it does not.  It requires TPM 2.0 and this laptop does NOT have TPM.  I confirmed that with 2 Samsung engineers today when Windows 11 Pro would not install.\"),\n",

Battery Life is amazing! If you are like me you hate when you are working out and the watch dies not recoding the steps or activities. This watch will last for 7 days2. The app is easy to use- If you are serious about measuring your activity great way to see how you are doing for the last several days, weeks, months...3. It measures what I care about steps and activityThe watch is not for you if you want-1. seeing emails and texts (not a strong feature)2. Trying to use it to answer callsI change my three stars to five stars after using it for awhile. The band and the orginal watch setup was not well designed but you can order a band for $10 and change the watch screen (use google to search how to do it, it is not hard but not obvious).The amazing battery life was what pushed it to 5 stars.Orginal Review-I had a Versa 2 and really liked it. I have very basic usages-steps, activity and as a watch. It did a wonderful job. It died and so I bought the Versa 4. 1. the watch ban is cheap!! the versa 2 was nothing great but this one is awful. (so i will have to buy another one to replace the one that comes with it). 2. the new watch face trys to do too much. KISS should have been there moto Keep it simple stupid. 3 the sync with the app seems to be off. I just got it so it just might take more time to get use to it.Im sure in the end it will be ok and do it's job. That is why 3 stars.\"),\n",

If I want the heartrate monitor to work, I cannot wear my fitbit on the wrist I typically wear a watch on, and that is deeply frustrating. I had the same issue with the Charge 4 and was really hoping this time would be different. (The Alta never had this issue, so I was hoping it was specific to the Charge 4 sensor. Alas!) If you have a tattoo sleeve, beware! And if you know of a fitness watch that works great on tattooed skin, I\\'d love to hear it.However, the Versa 4 has worked much better for tracking my heartrate (on my non-tattooed arm) when I am out on my bike. The Charge 4 heartrate monitor would often stop working while I was actively biking (maybe because of the jostling? How my wrist was positioned?), only working again when I was stopped at a stoplight or at the end of a ride. The Versa 4 monitor does not have this issue! It has been very reliable at tracking my heartrate while I am out on the trail, and I am much happier!I was hesitant to buy the Versa 4 because it is so much larger and bulkier than the other Fitbit models I have used in the past, but I do enjoy the \"Today\\'s Activity\" display that puts so many stats on one screen. There are also a lot of options for clock faces / displays, which I appreciate. It doesn\\'t feel as bulky to wear as I thought it would. The access to more information and displays has made it worth the larger size.My only other complaint is that I wish I could find a better option for more prominently displaying my heartrate zone while I am working out. This is the major reason I have a fitness tracker! I wanted a clock face or a tile that made this information easy to access. I figured out if I tell my fitbit to track my workout, that I can then swipe over to a screen with my heartrate zone visible. On my Charge 4, my clock face displayed this information all the time, and I loved it. I don\\'t love having to click through several menus to get this info on the Versa 4.'),\n",

I got the iPhone 14 Pro gold 256 gb and it’s working decently! Sorted through the seller list and I think I picked a great one to buy from. Happy with this purchase.Seller Selection:Need to switch to a new phone since my old one has already stopped updating iOS. I was afraid of getting scammed based on some of the reviews, so I sorted through the sellers list and looked through all of their ratings. I went for a slightly more expensive buy from a seller with a better review overall (actually read the reviews and don’t believe the %positive stuff from Amazon, Amazon marks some of the reviews as “Amazon’s fault” and thus do not count them into the overall seller rating, however sometimes the reviews they crossed out are really, the seller’s product problem, which makes the review system kinda sketchy and suspicious.)I got mine from the seller “The Cell Whiz 2” (it has just an average % positive review rate, but I notice that most of the problems associated with it are minor and the seller looks very responsive to the reviews, so I picked it) and, I’m happy with it so far. In fact, I’m writing my review on this phone right now!The phone:It came in a cardboard box with a charger, both wrapped in a little plastic bag. The packaging doesn’t have any foam or other kinds of protection, so I was a bit worried upon receiving it. Fortunately, nothing cracked or seemed broken.The phone itself is so spotless I was afraid of getting my grimy fingers on it! I inspected all over the phone and only found a tiny chipped paint scratch on the frame of one of the camera lens. Honestly, no one would even find out about it. And you can’t even see it after you put a lens protection glass on.Setting up the phone was no issue, I transferred from my physical SIM to an eSIM successfully (though I was a bit nervous during the wait and when I had to click on install cellular again). Apple transferred all my data from my previous iPhone to this one very smoothly. It’s exactly like my old phone, except on a newer model.The battery capacity it came with is 89%. It’s not THE BEST, but it’s really good. I can still use it for a while before I need to change it.Overall, I’m happy with this purchase and hopefully everyone who’s reading this review can get a phone they like <3'),\n",

My TA helped me pick out this model/set to start with as I needed a DSLR for my photo class and I was lost as to what to get. I’ve been using this camera and the various inclusions for the past couple of weeks, and it has really aided in improving my photos. There are quite a few things I haven’t used yet (like the filters) but the SD cards, reader, tripods, and bag have all been helpful. In fact, I found the included “Photo4Less” bag to be a little too big for my daily use. It will definitely hold a lot of extra accessories inside of it alongside the camera and kit lens. However, for my purposes, I went ahead and purchased another smaller bag for walking around town/campus with. The included bag would probably be good for traveling though.I found the seller of this bundle, Photo4Less, to be good. I received all my items on my estimated arrival date (fast shipping with prime) and nothing was damaged or not working properly.

I\\'m coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I\\'m currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I\\'m in grad school now and I\\'ve done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I\\'m using it for.- \"Just works\" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in \"Midnight\" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It\\'s overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it\\'s good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.'),\n",

I get about 11 days with gps. Sooo nice!The Versa 4 has me pretty much in love.All of the things that this watch can do is just amazing. I got it to monitor health, track my steps, and routes.. it does so much more. It's missing a few things, but I can live without them.Talking on it was cool for a minute, kinda felt like inspector gadget, but I'd rather just use my phone.. lol.I really wish it was linked to my alarms on my phone.. I got used to being able to hit snooze from my watch. The alarm on my Versa is a very dull vibration that I surprisingly can feel.. and is good at waking me up, but it goes off everyday, even when it's not set to.I think the steps are off a little bit, but aren't they all?!I miss having YouTube Music linked, so I could control what my earbuds played.. but it's ok.*edit* I figured this out and can now utilize the app.All the perks that this watch offer really outweigh the 2 or 3 things it doesn't do.The band is super soft, and doesn't irritate my skin at all, which had me concerned, because I have sensitive skin, and seen that some people had issues.*edit* after several months of wear I did start getting a red, raised, itchy rash. I ended up switching out the band and the rash has since resolved.It was super easy to add the Fitbit app onto my Samsung phone and get everything set up.I decided to try the premium for the free 6 months, and I'm pretty sure I'll keep it.. I like all the extra stats that are available, and $79 a year isn't bad. I mean, I pay $13.99 a month for no commercials on YouTube, so.. there's that.*edit* I did decide to keep premium and am enjoying the benefits.When you get everything all set up through your Google account you're offered a 2 year warranty on your watch for $29.99 that covers all sorts of stuff.. enter in the serial number and it's done.Great color, stays synched, nice big screen that I can see even in the brightest light, and it does everything it's supposed to.*edit* I do have issues from time to time with my watch syncing to my phone and will need to restart my phone for it to happen. It could be that I have an older model phone, or it could be the watch, but it is a very easy fix. I had to contact support (super fast, very friendly) and they walked me through this process the 1st time.Overall, this watch was a good price, lots of perks, helps me stay motivated, and I really like everything it keeps track of for me.\"),\n",

The application is trash, the touch feature is finicky and the noise cancelling is intermittent. I ended up buying the $60 Soundcore A40's and they are better in every single way.  Save your money, do not buy these Sony earbuds!!!!! I've never bought something so disappointing in all my life. I've never left such a negative review in all my life. This may all seem overly dramatic, but it's all the unvarnished truth, they are really that bad.I read the reviews, from what I can only now imagine were kickback scam review sites, and was super excited for these to arrive.These were my first wireless earbuds. I have some wireless headphones from Sennheiser that I love, but otherwise I use wired stuff for the most part. I am no audiophile, but my ears are fully functional so I can definitely tell the difference between headphone brands and models, I just don't really care about the differences.When I put these in and started a song, I laughed. I couldn't believe how trashy the sound was. In all my life I've never heard worse. Even $5 wired earbuds sound better (and the Soundcore A40's are miles ahead of these). After tweaking the EQ settings a bunch and trying my darndest to give these a fair shake, I was able to get them to a somewhat tolerable state, but wow they are still bad. I still have to chuckle writing this review how a product of this price could sound so awful.Speaking of messing with the EQ... I had to use their application, which I guess isn't uncommon with wireless earbuds. From the start it was a mess signing up, which it forces you to do (I am a 22 year professional computer tech veteran, the app was having all kinds of quirky issues).I kept getting repetitive prompts to set up voice command, which I didn't want to do and kept telling it no. It wouldn't let me pair multiple devices, so when I go in to the app and click on the text implying the capability, it pops up a window to tell me to go somewhere else in the app (which is poorly worded WHERE exactly) instead of just taking me there. Once I got it set up and had two devices paired, it requires you to USE THE APP to switch between them. My Sennheiser and my Soundcores both link to more than one device, and if one barges in audio wise, it pauses what you are doing on the other.The noise canceling seems to cut in and out, it's super obvious when the noise canceling is on as it makes an annoying sound, which I've not noticed from other noise canceling devices. If you turn off noise canceling, the sound quality gets even worse. I didn't think that as possible, but yet they managed.The touch capability is poorly executed. It does not register touches correctly. But I will say they have a nifty feature of pausing whatever you are listening to when you remove an earbud, which is nice.They are comfortable and the materials are nice.In the end I bought the Soundcore A40's and love everything about them. If you've stuck with this review this long, I can't stress enough how complete and utter trash these Sony earbuds are. I'm ashamed to share how much tech I buy from Amazon in a year and I've never been so disappointed with any tech purchase in my entire life. The saddest part is I didn't even spend my own money, so it's not like I'm bitter about a $300 purchase. Work paid for these, but even with free money this purchase made me mad over their audacity to release something so awful and put a $300 price tag on it.\"),\n",

I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!\"),\n",

With the Bose, the noise cancellation has been (as expected) unparalleled, almost to the point of being downright dangerous (can\\'t hear a thing when these things are on). In addition; without any tweaking, highs/mids & bass have been outstanding across the board with pretty much any genre in my eclectic playlist.Though I\\'m an Android user, I\\'ve been using (until they were recently stolen), the AirPods Pro (1st gen). Not the most comfortable nor best fitting (tendency for randomly popping out during a workout + having to frequently re-twist/screw them into your ear canal every so often) & obvious severe limitations with customization unless you\\'re paired w/ another Apple product, but I had picked them up for a great price & they did their job. This being said, if anyone was unhappy with the fit/seal of the AirPods Pro, then the fit of WF-1000XM5 are going to drive you bonkers.The finish of the earbuds are a beautiful piano black, but removing from the case (which is a challenge) is also a bit confusing of \"how do I put this thing into my ear?\" I felt like I was trying to cram a rock or marble into my ear & even when it was positioned correctly, never felt as if they were secure (always felt & looked like they were on the verge of popping out). Yes, there is noise cancellation, but there was never a seal like the Bose (which may be a good thing for some), so you can still pick up ambient sound to some degree (vs being in a virtual sensory deprivation tank w/ the Bose). Bose, however, did an excellent job w/ the fit directed towards the ear, where the bud literally slides/pops/seals into place with nothing more than a slight nudge (as if it was custom designed for your ear) vs Sony\\'s design, which felt as if actually fitting comfortably in an ear (or just \"fitting in an ear\") was an afterthought.Sound-wise, the highs/mids weren\\'t as crisp as the Bose & the bass was nearly non-existent. I tested w/ the same playlist, with Rock, Rap, Hawaiian, 80\\'s R&B, 90\\'s, etc... & the Sony\\'s (unlike the Bose, particularly w/ some nostalgic bangers from my H.S. days & earlier), did not make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.Outside of the less than stellar performance of the buds (as well as the extremely challenging fit), the design of the case itself (which is deceivingly smaller than the Bose) is also very slippery (a cover/skin, assuming available, is an absolute must), particularly with the buds themselves being nearly identical in size (the Sony\\'s having a much larger overall mass vs the Bose / check out my side-by-side pics comparison). Again, smaller case, beautiful design/finish, but where it matters the most (fit/sound), these pale in comparison to the QC II\\'s...'),\n",

It is simple and the interface is decent. I do not want a watch that attempts to replace my phone, but rather one that complements it. I think that the Fitbit Versa is a good choice for this. It tells me notifications, tracks sensor telemetry, tracks my physical state, and has decent battery life. These are things that my phone cannot easily do.Other smart watches such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch do too much. I don\\'t really care that I can reply to texts, browse the web, or essentially replace my phone. I always have my phone on or near me. If I am too busy to reply on my phone then I also wouldn\\'t reply on my watch, an only worse experience because they try to cram a full QWERTY keyboard on it.I bought the Fitbit Versa 4 because one of my requirements is that the watch I use has Google Pay on it. It does not at release, but I\\'m fine with it coming later as it is not an immediate requirement. I also assumed that the fitness tracking on Fitbit would be good because Fitbit is basically the oldest consumer tracker company I know of, so I guessed it probably works well.Comfort - 9/10The strap that it came with is quite comfortable. I do not wear watches, primarily because the ones I have tried were not very comfortable.  This watch and strap is pretty good. I\\'ve only had one day tuning the tightness and position where it was uncomfortable and that was my fault as it was too tight. I also like that it is small and light. I mostly forget it is there, and am comfortable sleeping it with.Update Nov. 5th 2022: After about a month of wearing it almost 24/7 I have some irritation. Also if I sleep with it and put weight upon the watch band (the watch face going down in to the bed) I will wake up with a lot of irritation.Interface  - 7/10The interface is mostly intuitive. It is not that clunky as some smart watches I have seen in the past. The main thing I do not like and I didn\\'t quite get at first was that the apps list is found by pressing the button. I didn\\'t know how to use the alarm the first night because of this. But overall it works. It is mostly responsive, but sometimes not if it is rendering many things in the interface. I can forgive this as it is not a super powerful watch. I am happy with this.Battery life- 8/10One of the primary things that I want in a smart watch is a longish battery life. The more general smart watches\\' battery life is not that great. This one lasts about 3 days with the always on display turned on, which I am happy with. I will try it with the always on display off to see how it lasts. With sleep mode on it drains about 10% battery over 8 hours.Update Nov. 5th 2022: With display not on always-on, then it lasts about 7-9 days depending on how much I exercise.Sleep Tracking - 10/10I am quite impressed with the sleep tracking. I don\\'t have to tell it anything. It just knows that I am sleeping and tracks it. Even random naps that I take in the evening. I do not know the times I fall asleep, but it is always on the exact minute I wake up. Good job on this, and I quite like it. As for the oxygen saturation tracking, I have nothing to compare it against so who knows, it could be made up for all I know.Heart rate - 3/10Oof, this is not good and I am quite disappointed with. During the day at work and home it seems to be fine. This is good for capturing my resting heart rate which I am interested in. But during workouts it is basically useless. I have worked out 3 times with it since I got it, and it is just wildly inaccurate. The only thing it is good for is using the workout timer to count my pulse manually. While doing some spinning in the gym I consistently measure my pulse at 170-180 BPM, but this thing is measuring as low as 90 BPM to 160 BPM, usually ranging in 130-150. I can forgive being off by 10 or so BPM, but this is just wild. Once my heart rate goes about 140 or 150 it just becomes useless. It will vary by 10 BPM each measurement, vibrate warning my heart rate is not in \"the zone.\" Well that sucks. I bought this thing specifically so that I could track my workout, hoping because Fitbit is a well known brand that it would do this specific thing well, and it does not.Other -I like the alarm, but I think all watches do something like that. I use the weather occasionally, and the timer is fine. I would prefer that it sets the timer, and allows me to actually start it rather than automatically starting when I lock-in a time, but that a minor gripe. The phone interface is good, and I think that it summarizes the telemetry pretty well. I also like the default watchface, and have not changed it.Update Nov. 5th 2022: I did not realize this before, but the alarm only alarms for like 20 or 30 seconds before turning off. This is fine some times, but other times I need way more effort to wake up. I have no seen a way to configure this. I would prefer that it alarms until I turn it off.ConclusionIf I can find a smart watch that is similar size, as I do like that this one is small and light, I may replace it. Mainly because of the heart rate tracking. But I am very impressed with the sleep tracking, and i like the battery life and comfort so I am going to stick with it for now. I hope that heart rate tracking can be fixed with a software update, because I do want to like this watch.'),\n",

If u ever have issue you will need.3rd & final what you read for---➡️❤️ My original review is below and still valid but after cleaning and adjusting tips, I'm happy to report I haven't had the 'connect from pocket problem'. Changing the tips made a big diff, but they're not near as secure and comfortable as pixel buds pro for my everyday use. That bring said, the pass through, pass thru blend, etc are the best hands down. Their competition isn't even close for this category(IMO_of_course).The only thing I find myself having to adjust often. They want to sit halfway in my ear, instead of locked into place. Many times when I go to adjust, I hit pause, which could be disabled in all fairness. I still use these as my everyday buds though, and are about to try more tips when I can find the time. They are superior in sound and especially the noise cancellation/passthrough/blend feature. It's actually amazing how good they are in all honesty. (If you don't like foam tips, get some silicone because these only come with the foam style.) (The tips are the same though as any other set.)I just wanted to come back and follow up.They deserve five stars.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. I have to leave the one star off but if I could I'd rate them 4.7-4.8, so sorry it's not five stars for a pretty solid product.I hope this can help someone, and give yourself a day or two once getting to be able to see the difference, since they have some pretty solid picks out there. Thanks, & may the good Lord bless.❤️I had the 3rd & 4th Gen earbuds, so upon getting these, I was wondering did I make the right choice, coming from pixel buds pro? I'm happy to report, that after changing the tips to some older silicone traditional Sony tips, they surprised me how nice they were to use. I also was happy about the longer lasting battery, and quality passthrough experience then what I had gotten used to. All in all, these are pleasantly nice once I put the silicone ear tips on. They fit perfect now and have my recommendation. Edit- I've had a little time with them, and the couple things I don't care for so far, is Amazon music service; I disabled nearby devices, because every time I connect buds after accepting update, they offer a service to be ready to play music with a tap. It's good if that's what you want, but not for me at the time. Now the other issue is actually an issue that has me really concerned whether I want to use them long-term. The right ear bud every time I look is connected in the case/paired to my phone which is a dealbreaker if I can't seem to correct. I'm sorry to report this because it's something that matters a lot to me and a reason I would return to the pixel buds pro. Anyway the sound and noise cancellation is second to none , and I can honestly say, they close the pixel buds pro out of the water.

Sound was lackluster at first because none of the included ear tips worked for me. That foam material that Sony uses doesn't work for all people, perhaps that's why other manufacturers like Apple, Sennheiser and B&W use silicone tips (which also are easier to clean and age better). Once I bought compatible silicone ear tips (link below), I got a good seal and was able to truly enjoy these earbuds.Pros:- Excellent sound quality. I would say they sound better than Apple AirPods Pro.- The mobile App includes an equalizer to tune them exactly the way you want them.- Last firmware allows you to use head gestures to control them.- Full-featured mobile App.- Construction is great. Both the earbuds and case are solidly built.- Good noise cancellation- Smaller and lighter than the previous version.Cons:- Although noise cancellation is good, it's not as good as Apple's AirPods Pro.- Mobile App is a little convoluted to navigate, but it's not too bad.Neutral:- Although they are smaller than the previous version, they still protrude out of your ears more than other offerings like Apple AirPods. They are on-par to other offerings like Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3 and B&W, so it's not too bad.These are the ear tips I used. They work great:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0989NHFGW\"),\n",

Wasn’t worth the cost of repair. Have others from QCY and Soundcore that were surprisingly good for less cost. Also had trouble with refurbished headphones WH-1000XM4, luckily had added insurance. Cut to buying a new pair that have been flawless.Got the Sony WF-C700N a couple months ago to scratch my earbud itch. Very good for the price. If you’re not ready to throw down $300 for the XM5 they’re a great alternative. Not quite as musical, but no gripes anyway. You can get picky about the throwback buttons but oh well.One comment before I get more specific on the XM5. I fully agree with another review that calls out Sony for how complicated their Sony Connect app has become. It could be simplified for people who don’t want to get into the tech so much.Now, how do they sound? I’m impressed and I’m not using them to their full potential. Using with iPhone so Bluetooth SBC codec is the most basic and lowest quality solution (after digging into the codec question a bit more it does appear that the iPhone has the AAC codec also). However, with the help of Sony’s equalizer and DSEE function I’m very happy with the sound. I almost don’t want to try them with a better codec and then have to go back. (Still applies with AAC, DSE does improve sound)I need treble boost for my old ears and having played bass no surprise I like a lot of bass. These don’t disappoint. I did an A-B comparison with the XM4 headphones and they didn’t have quite the low end but good and punchy with good definition between bass and drums.both can become nice and “growly” on the low end.Noise cancellation is very good, not as good as the headphones but after only a couple days I have been quite satisfied so far.Comfort level is better than the XM4 buds, but I’m so pissed I wasted the money now I don’t want to dig them out to compare audio! I think Sony really improved the fit and design to be lighter, more comfortable, and have impressive sound. Let’s just hope they found a better battery.Used overnight and had battery left in the morning but playing audiobook on timer so i couldn’t say how long continuous playback.I’ll update after I’ve had them longer.(Update) battery life seems to be very similar to the XM4. Sometimes I have battery left in the morning sometimes it comes up short.Another follow up, comes with 4 sets of tips but apparently I have very large ear canals as I’m unable to get a complete seal with the included buds. The large felt good at first but when I used the connect app to check for airtight seals I could not get them to seal. Fortunately I have many tips I’ve saved over the years and by mixing, matching, and testing I have a couple that seal. I even tried ordering extra large tips from a couple vendors and they didn’t work either. Nice that Sony is including extra small but what about us with extra large needs! I do have a possible solution on the way, find a video on YouTube that shows how to use Sugro glue rolled up and inserted in the mushroom part of the tip. Press in the ear to get a fit and then allow to cure over night. Hoping it works, I have a few tips I’d like to try this on. Was even investigating custom molded tips but for $150 plus I’ll try the Sugro hack…8/5/23 tried the Sugro hack yesterday. Still have to work to get an airtight fit but it definitely helped.My opinion on the sound has not diminished. Excellent with what I listen too. A lot of classic rock but also new material from Elle King and others. Listening to Lourdes “Royals” a very deep bass which presents low, solid, and clear. You can easily distinguish the bass and drums. The low rumbling bass of Pink Floyd “Welcome to the Machine” couldn’t be much better in any buds. Almost like I could feel it.I’m now using the WF-C700n as my workout and dog walking buds. Sound signature is very similar but the bass is not quite as good. One thing they are lacking is the airtight fit check in the app. I had to use other tips and the Sugro mold hack to get a good consistent fit in both. The included tips are worthless to me and my big ears.I see a lot of criticism of the noise cancellation for the XM5. I have no way to measure so it’s pretty subjective but I’m not disappointed. At least as good as the XM4. But with any ANC earbuds the airtight seal is critical.If you’re not ready to throw down $300 the WF-C700n are a very good alternative, but are not touch controlled, a single button on each side. Not quite as good on the low end but not disappointing either. In direct comparison you can hear the difference.I still think these are 5 star worthy. I’d take off half a star because of the somewhat complex app but if you like to tinker with the sound and features, give it back. People who are not “technical minded” may find it intimidating. I find it useful but jammed with some features I wouldn’t normally use, like automatically changing settings depending on location as an example. Some might find it useful but not me. The equalizer and clear bass functions are excellent. DSEE function makes a noticeable difference in sound quality. Happier with these than I was with the XM4. Just hope the batteries last, I would hope Sony changed from the $70 replacement cost batteries (not including labor) used in the XM4 as apparently so many people had problems with them dying out after a few months.9/22/23Used these today instead of the WF-C700n for my indoor cycling and to walk the dog. Usually I do those activities with the cheaper buds as for $300 I want to take every precaution to protect them. So…more feedback on the ANC. Definitely a difference on the bike with 2 pretty loud blower fans on. The WF-C700n does a very good job in the same situation but I could definitely tell a difference. Could hardly hear the fans at all and the WF-1000XM5 does have the superior sound performance. Note these blowers are loud enough that if I have my Apple Watch to close to them I get the over 90db warning. They’re not 90db from the bike but they are loud. These cancelled almost all the noise. With volume on my music I don’t hear the fans at all.'),\n",

I bought these WF-1000MX5 to replace a pair of WF-1000MX4 that were lost/stolen.  After using the MX5's for 6 months I can notice the sound quality and battery drainage has improved slightly over the previous generation.  However, the noise cancelling technology seems to be getting worse.  It seems to only work well with constant noise sources such as noisy fans or motors.  They do not work well with sudden loud noises such cars, impacts, dog barks, talking, etc..  I find that my older WF-1000MX3 had better noise cancelling than the MX4 or MX5.  Also, the MX5's always reset to ambient mode when you use them which a major source of frustration.  So you always need to open the Sony connect app or enable NC mode via a earbud button if assigned. It never did that with the older generation products. I've heard of similar complaints online about the MX5 noise cancelling mode.The MX3 earbuds suffered from battery issues and I am on my 2nd battery but the noise cancelling is much better than the MX5 earbuds in my opinion.  Perhaps subjective, but to me it seems Sony has dropped the ball on noise cancelling with it's newer products.  The new design and shape of the earbuds also makes them fiddely to get a good seal in your ear which also affects noise cancelling.  I am not impressed because I bought them thinking they would be improving this technology.  I have similar opinions about the newer Sony TVs.  Sony quality is definitely declining.  In summary this product is okay, but definitely not as great as the reviews hype them to be.  If you don't care about noise cancelling then they will suit you fine.Not sure I'll be wasting my money on Sony in the future though.\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'B0C33XXS56', 'row': 265, 'product_title': 'Sony WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds', 'rating': '5', 'summary': 'Fantastic!'}, page_content='review: I bought these because I had a gift card to spend, and in hopes that I could completely separate from my Airpod Pro’s (1rst gen). I wanted to get rid of my Airpod pro’s because I have become so completely fed up with popping them in my ears and having only one earbud connect. That happens about 25% of the time I use them, and of course it’s always right when I’m in a hurry and need them now. I have to reset them every time it happens and frankly I’m fed up with it – unacceptable reliability.So, it’s only been a little more than a week but I haven’t had this happen once. Nor has it ever happened on any of my other true wireless earbuds (Soundcore Liberty 4 NC’s and some cheap no-name sports hook-style earbuds). The Sony’s have had stellar reviews, but my one reservation was that I’m in a full Apple ecosphere, and I had read that if you’re in the Apple ecosphere, you’ll want the Airpod Pro series II. Using anything else would mean missing out on that typical Apple integration – things work great together. Well, I’ve never tried the Airpod Pro II’s, but I couldn’t get myself to reward Apple by ordering another pair of headphones from them after my dissatisfaction with the AirPod Pro I’s.So, how are the Sony’s? Absolutely fantastic and boy, am I glad I went with them! First of all, in terms of integration/functionality with my Apple world, best I can tell so far its flawless. Transitions between my iPhone 15 and iPad Pro are just as smooth as my AirPods were. I can send/receive calls just as easily, and the Sony has one feature I don’t think AirPods have – you can just nod your head to answer calls! I also find the touch sensor vastly superior to Apple’s squeeze surface (or whatever it’s called). Much more intuitive to me, and it works every time on the first try.Another big advantage the Sony’s have over the Airpod Pro I’s is battery life. One reason I picked the Sony’s was better sleep. My wife makes quite a racket sleeping at night and I had read that these were great for sleeping. My Airpod Pro’s were also quite good at that, but they wouldn’t last through the night – only about 4.5 hours (w/NC on). Not sure how long the Sony can last, but I’ve gone over 8 hours (w/NC on) – and they still had some battery left! As for the noise cancelling, I’d say it’s slightly disappointing. I also own the over-ear WH-1000XM5’s, and they have AWESOME noise cancelling! I’d say the WF-1000XM5’s are nowhere near that level – I’d say they are about the same as my Airpod Pro I’s. Good enough to attenuate my wife’s snoring (at least enough that I can sleep), but not completely block it (so I hear nothing at all) as on the WH-1000XM5’s. But of course, the WH-1000MX5’s are way too big to sleep with (full size over-ear headphones). Another minor disappointment is no “find my earbud” functionality, which makes me a little paranoid about losing them, but hopefully not a big deal.Saving the best for last is the sound quality. I bought the big-brother WH-1000XM5’s a year ago and was quite surprised at their sound quality. Same thing here – these sound fantastic! I’m a fairly serious audiophile and have quite a collection of high-end headphones, including one pair of earbuds that are more than triple the cost of these Sony’s (JH Audio J13 v2’s). And all the electronics to go with it (DAP’s, DAC’s, amps, cables, etc.). They took a while to break in properly (maybe 30-50 hours) but they are really wonderful. They are among the most natural sounding earbuds I’ve heard and I’m a bit stumped how that could be possible since it uses crappy Bluetooth. My high-end headphones are fed almost exclusively high-rez files. Bluetooth AAC (can’t use LDAC on an iPhone) is the best I can run, which of course are only a small fraction the bitrate resolution of true high-rez files. But somehow these sound absolutely wonderful – just a natural “rightness” that’s hard to describe. BY FAR the best bass I’ve ever heard from an earbud. They have a confidence, an “assertiveness” (yes, that’s a new audio metaphor) – not aggressiveness - that I just love. I’m not saying that they are flat-out better than my high-end earbuds (my Shure M535’s are my favorite), but I will say they are at least in the same ballpark. I can pop these in and really enjoy listening for hours – and not feel like I’m missing out in not using my much more expensive earbuds. Very high compliment indeed! So, great job Sony! BTW, I read that Sony bought Audeze (high-end true audiophile headphone brand), which means I can’t wait to see what they come out with in the future – if these are as good as they are, I can’t wait to find out what the XM6’s or XM7’s will sound like!Update 4/16/24: Just wanted to mention one more remarkable thing about these. I am an avid cyclist and I’ve been on a long search to find the best earbuds for cycling - which for me, is mostly about reducing WIND NOISE. That is by far my biggest goal for cycling headphones. These are downright spooky in their ability to hugely reduce wind noise - BY FAR the most effective I’ve ever tried, and I’ve tried quite a few (AirPod Pro’s, Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, etc…). So now I face an interesting dilemma - do i dare use a $300 pair of earbuds for cycling? The problem with using them for cycling is that cycling is of course brutal on earbuds (constant sweat). So I’ll have to decide if I dare to do that long term, but I can say that these are by far the best headphones I have ever used in terms of wind blocking. So these really are amazing - fantastic sound, powerful noise cancelling, long battery life and the best wind noise blocking I’ve ever heard…'),\n",

I do senior pictures for fellow students and family portraits. The quality is amazing it’s easy enough to use point click and the flash works fantastic. The extra light I’ve set up as an exterior light for some photo projects and it’s worked fantastically. The tripod works in any ground pretty much with the help of a small level on the top of it. If I’m on a hill and I wanna know if it’s straight it works perfectly. The lenses are great! Perfect condition when the arrived, they are exactly what I wanted and what a steal! The UV lens is perfect for super gloomy days I think. It makes them look a little brighter in my opinion less bleh. Which is always nice. The bag it comes with is sturdy no tears no holes! The dividers are movable. You can take them out and switch them around! Which is nice since I’m always switching out the stuff I need for work! It has a million pockets to fit everything you need! The lenses have small pouches and covers to put on and in when you’re not using them. Handy indeed! The two SD cards work great! It has a little wallet like case for them that can attach to the cameras strap for easy convenient use! It does not has an extra battery for the camera however! It charges super fast in an hour and a half (1hr 30 mins) usually it’ll be fully charged! It’s also WiFi enabled! Meaning if you ya ether cannon app you can use your camera remotely through the app! You can also download pictures from it and tag locations you’ve shot at! Super handy!!!! The small clicker you can hook up on the side of camera is great! It works great! It’s very short however. Use only when working with nervous kids so they don’t see you take the picture! The pocket tripod isn’t that useful for me personally but maybe a smaller vlogger or general YouTuber could find it useful it’s only about 5 inches high but it’s super sturdy! The camera might look to big but it holds up great! I use the strap it’s semi comfortable it needs broken in but I don’t recommend it. It’s rough around the edges of it but still usable. I’m ordering a better strap because I use it often and my neck will hurt after shooting for 4-5 hours.Overall great package!

I updated the firmware on the watch, tried doing a factory reset twice, uninstalled/reinstalled the fitbit app twice, ensured that the app wasn\\'t allowed to go to sleep when in the background... nothing worked.  It would work for a few minutes, then when I tried to command Alexa, it would say connection lost.  I decided to contact support, and they informed me that my app was outdated.  Come to find out, version 4.04 of the bitbit app is too old, and will not work.  The latest version, 4.06.7 had not been released for my phone yet, as is typical ridiculous play store behavior.  Google... are you listening?  When a developer releases an update, you shall IMMEDIATELY make it available to EVERY device!  I manually downloaded the apk and installed it, and everything has been working great since.  Alexa follows my direct orders immediately, phone calls come through, texts come through, and I can sync with ease.Overall, I suppose this is an improvement over the Versa 2.  Screen is a little bigger, but the notification vibrations don\\'t seem to be as forceful, even when set to strong.This uses google wallet instead of google pay as the Versa 2 did, so my AmEx will not work for contactless payment.Phone call feature is nice, seems to work OK.  I can hear them, they can hear me.  You can only answer calls, you can\\'t make them.  The $50 brand x watch I ordered to replace this one before I got the sync figured out was able to do that.  It could also control my camera and music player, neither of which is possible on the Versa 4.Google maps is nice if you walk in unfamiliar areas.  I\\'ll probably never need it, but it\\'s nice.Battery life seems to be improved over the Versa 2, but mine was 2 years old so I\\'m sure the battery had gradually decreased it\\'s charge capacity.  I used it for several days, and he battery was still at 55%.Skin temperature sensor will one day be nice when it can sync with a smart thermostat and automatically adjust the temperature as needed.  But for now, it\\'s just a novelty and has no purpose.  Yes, I know my skin is hot.  I woke up in a puddle of sweat.  Yup, I\\'m freezing, so my skin is cold.o2 saturation is nice if you have any relevant health problems.If you want to take full advantage of the watch, get the free \"Overview\" clock face by Chris Blyth.  It gives you current and average heart rate, battery percentage, fully customizable date format, allows for a larger clock that shows seconds, and you can have weather, and 6 other health stats displayed on the main screen, all at once.  I have steps, distance, calories burned, active zone minutes, floors, and BMI/BMR.  It all fits, and is easy to read.  Vast improvement over the default face, which shows no useful information.  I had th is face on my versa 2, and loved it.  So glad it\\'s available for the 4.Bottom line, it\\'s a good watch.  There are cheaper brand x ones out there, but none of them have NFC payment, and not all of them have Alexa.  And, you get what you pay for.  fit & finish feels cheap, the screens get washed out in the sun, finicky alexa integration and so on.  Best to pony up and get a refined product.  Be sure to update your fitbit app.  Their customer support said the latest version should be released within a week, but I circumvented the beurocracy and downloaded it manually.  Why wait?'),\n",

Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It\\'s overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it\\'s good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable.

It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars.
